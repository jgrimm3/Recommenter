viisa i want horizon zero dawn 2 wild is finally coming out x to doubt most hyped for ghost of tsushima looks amazing and i can t wait knox ashley r bru elden ring to be honest i could care less about new games this year i ve actually been too busy playing games on my ps3 and getting all nostalgic i feel like most games coming out in 2020 are kinda boring that s just my opinion the last of us 2 better not be all sjw d out because it feels like that s where it is going destroy all humans for ps4 only nah cyberpunk should be by faaaar no 1 i would like to see a mega man style boss system and open world title screen choose your area 3rd person over shoulder view so open world closed system platformer destroy all humans was og i was waiting for him to say rust good show so hyped for so many games ffvii last of us 2 where is rust yakuza like a dragon is a soft reeboot kyru story ended for good in y6 so the new protagonist is a nobody and not a monster like kiryu and majima were so he needs the help of others to come up on top is a new direction since the ryu ga tokou studio said in an small interview that they did everything they could and wanted to do the brawling basic system of yakuza so they want to try new things and i approve the main complain from people that have play y7 is that the game is too easy on the other hand the platinum doesnt required to 100 all mini games and activities which is great some of yakuza mini games were really boring nioh one of the best souls game out there you are goddamm right he is excited for all 30 games on the list there is nothing negative about any of the games that s the reason i unsubscribed a while ago just to point out in watchdogs ctos isn t responsible for anything it s just an os blume is responsible for everything

clickbait if so we all want last of us good choice i see they will be a delay for ps5 so meh none or these games interest me suposubly spelled supposedly that one is my pet peeve lol still pronouncing it eye teration i see game has cartoon art style everyone zelda botw ripoff u telling me there is not a single racing game in the top 20 wtf 2020 year of the playstation i just want rust and dungeon defenders awakened rip to all of our wallets my playstation fam ghost of tsushima is the only game that really piques my interest ghost of tsushima is the only game that really piques my interest game exists falcon how could you not want this game exists falcon how could you not want this take your medication phew thank god i only wanna buy the top 5 games i want horizon zero dawn 2 wild is finally coming out x to doubt wolf donna a you just copied a comment lol hell yeah horizon zero dawn 2 would be awesome who doesn t pray for horizon zero dawn 2 and a new assasin s creed horizon zero dawn was pretty boring after an hour or so scan the robot then shoot it s weak spot with that specific arrow it didn t require that much skill gets old fast and the story could have been told in half the time it was dragged on abit too much if they fix those problems in 2 it would be cool soso many remakes in video games and blockbuster movies i wonder wij lol shadow of mordor 3 ghost of tsushima is taking sooooo long to come out between halo infinite ghost of tsushima and cyberpunk 2077 i m dying of anticipation he save the best game for last this guy really reminds me of philip defranco 1 elden ring 2 re3 3 cyberpunk 2077 4 the last of us ii everything else is wack ghost or tsushima and tlou2 3 this man said nioh had a good character and story must be an ign lackey dam i am playing the witcher 3 ps4 for the first time how am i going to play some of these man i need a bigger wallet and hard drive can t wait for the last of us give me elden ring fromsoftware that predator gamr looks amazing if they could expand that with 2 predators vs 8 soldiers 3 v 12 4 v 16 there s also rust for ps4 yet to be announced the release what happend to dying light 2 and gta 6 you sound so fed up throughout the whole video ok but what about biomutant that game looks amazing lmao i started playing nioh the other day actually beat it last night and now i m unnecessarily hyped for nioh 2 s release despite being broke af anyway regarding ps4 games i m most hyped for re3 last of us and elden ring but still need to get kakarot what about biomutant i what last of us 2 i can t wait for resident evil 3 you forgot wolf among us 2 from the list i think yakuza like a dragon may be a new direction at series because in japan it is regarded as ryu ga gotoku yakuza 7 nah this is too late its about ps5 now the guy narrating sounds like ed helms i sometimes regret buying a xbox one me i don t have money but still gonna watch the video same me can t wait for radbrad to play these games bro what i thought cyberpunk was coming out in march that fucking sucksssssss is game season finally back am i going crazy or did he forget to mention dying light 2 that s a super anticipated game w h e r e i s g t a 6 the new yakuza yes it is a bad thing you know they say don t change a winning team right yakuza always was a little crazy yes but this new yakuza is changing the game wayyyyyyy too much absolutely no support from me wow most of these look trash yeah post brexit as that was something bad with eu being all pro european right and police state well if you want to silence the opposition against the destruction of the english people and all the cooooollll multiculti bs well then you have to create a policestate yakuza like a dragon i hate that name is yakuza 7 its in the main line yakuza games series but just a whole new character and city since kazuma s story is done i m not fond of the turn based combat formula but hopefully its fun and they balance it out with less combat encounters coz thats wht they need to do or it ll cause major burnout i ve been waiting for wild for years hope we get need this year the predator game graphics look like a ps2 game can t see that doing too well szymon szor how does it look anything like a ps2 game they should try to make a volleyball game in vr or controller announce gta 9 and what about the new assasins creed about vikings gta 6 i think you missed the stanley parable ultra deluxe gam i will get the predator one for my pc idk why i am watching this i m on pc were is minecraft dungeons gta 6 was never going to buy it but it s getting extremely annoying hearing wild is coming out pfft no it s fuckin nooot they said that like 5 years ago time stamps i see cyberpunk as the least likely to be delayed tells you quite a bit dont it how tf is disintegration so high the gameplay was so critically rejected on how boring it looked cyberpunk and ghost of tsushima best games so far persona 5 is one of the worst games ever imagine these on pc am i the only one who doesn t like all of em but i only like the last of us 2 how could you want any of these game hey guys i post somethings about game informations on instagram feel free to check it out game spots your stupid not to include dying light 2 most of them actually doesnt worth paying but still there is some good games the next assassins creed game wut about little nightmares 2 yeah my hype kinda died for cyberpunk now last of us 2 where s fifa 21 i m jk incase you guys couldn t tell for some reason but seriously tho dying light 2 got nominated for the most wanted game of 2020 but wasn t on this list smh what about biomutant for number 1 you missspelt rust ya i know i m excited for the swsh dlc that s dropping it seems we re getting a lot outta this and i can t wait to explore more of the galar region how is cyberpunk number 3 wtf doom eternal comes out in march super hype for hunting grounds i ve wanted another predator game since concrete jungle dreams god s monsters destroy all humans ghost of tsushima skull and bones cyberpunk 2077 all gonna be bangers hi gameranx may i ask what is the title of the background music used between 10 50 to 12 20 minutes of this video many thanks can t believe i m saying it but i think my years of gaming are coming to an end past few years have been disappointing for big games in my opinion only game i m left enjoying is battlefront 2 why is he pronouncing yakuza like that makes it pretty obvious he hasn t touched a single game in the series the last of us part 2 looking for the next big game to play with all my friends everyone that i play with is slowly getting out of fortnite and we re struggling to find a good game to all play together any suggestions would be awesome bruh you didn t say rust iteration isn t supposed to be pronounced like iphone bugs me way more than it should i am most excited for the last of us 2 and dying light 2 can you guys stop comparing games that have no absolute similarity at least the cyberpunk 2077 didn t delay until 2077 how could you not want last of us 2 because i played a little of the first game and it was garbage skull and bones and ghost of tsushima and pc i ve never played a persona game other than one of the arenas is persona 5 royal a good purchase to make for a new comer idiots buying ps4 games in 2020 me an intellectual waiting for ps5 you are the idiot buy ps4 games in 2020 and buy the ps5 next year when it s cheaper hi sheldon just shut up you just don t have enough cash to buy the stuff you want right now andreas dluffy i was just joking no way i m going to buy the first waves of fucked up ps5 consoles i m letting others take the fall for me they re the meat sheilds rip to all of our wallets my playstation fam i want horizon zero dawn 2 hunt showdown dud this list made me realize that my wallet is in big danger this man is obsessed with his grappling hook shotgun quit stealing comments dude my wallet will never forgive me ghost of tsushima is my most anticipated game ever would ve been better playing only as the predator in a polished concrete jungle style game you put a cdprjkt red game lower than number 1 why did i come here watch dogs looks like hipster trash 0 43 his instrumental at 10 46 mother i require your card s assistance did you say midgrr blasphemy haha i know this is a late comment but what the f no rust on the list last of us part ii is all i care about i ve been as patient as humanly possible for wild to release don t go playin me with a 2020 release theory if you re not 110 positive it s coming this year they love mispronunciation i want a new infamous game i did not want tlou2 the ending for the first one was nearly perfect 14 34 grand theft auto cyberpunk 2077 cool shit my current list of games to buy for 2020 amounts to like 250 are you sure that skull and bones come this year out i waiting so long for this game rip to all of our wallets my playstation fam disintegration vader no disintegrations boba as you wish game exists falcon how could you not want this albert d mcglynn hello and funny comment this generation of gaming consoles are so fucking disappointing still pronouncing it eye teration i see he pronounced yakuza wrong too queen purr no he didn t he pronounced it as the japanese do he says bolth 1 elden ring ohhhh elden ring 2 re3 remake 3 doom eternal 4 halo infinite 5 nioh 2 its funny how halo is not even mentioned in the video lol halo is xbox volodya chuvak kuznetsov oh yeah makes sense now thx and yeah halo is xbox and xbox is halo if you think about it snowrunner 2 should have made this list change to 30 boring generic overhyped games until i can play games like gta iv skyrim the witcher 3 the last of us uncharted gta v games that actually revolutions gaming and keep you playing then i dont feel like i want to play them re3 remake and the last of us part 2 can t wait just bullshit compare to rdr2 im so excited for the last of us 2 eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee ghosts of tsushima doom eternal and most of all the last of us part 2 those are the three that i m willing to break the bank with pre ordering what about rust coming to console what about samurai jack i die a little inside whenever he says yakuza what about rust maybe half of these will actually drop lol i m so sick of just lit trailers gameranx hasn t been doing to hot i think it s funny i think it s fun falcon h kan lundin hello haha doom eternal ranks 6 666 exists coincidence i think not any racing games i think ff7 remake is not that anticipated by fans as the internet makes you suggest because i was at gamescom 2019 and there was a big booth like really big where you could play the game but there were barely any people playing i had the opportunity to go there and play myself but i didnt go even though i wouldve only had to wait for 15min or so idk but that is kinda telling something idk but i feel like the narrator is lying when he says he is excited or likes almost every single game because gamers always have a preference of genre so i can not share this kind of excitement for every single different genre it just feels like plain lying to me i m excited for rust to come out on ps4 why does the thumbnail remind me of coryxkenshin it eration not eye it eration i wonder what the next playstation free to play game will be dying light 2 is a bonus game hhh you are a joke brother i didn t like any of the games tbh all of them were about the future and super technological stuff so go back to ps2 era then godfall looked interesting a trusty eagle it s a hawk where is assassin creed ragnarok another great video thanks falcon if i buy the last of us 2 on ps4 will i need to buy it again on ps5 im sorry but i think vr is wack as fuck at least for now lol everything from the graphics gameplay even physical system is just ugly until i can slide some reading glasses on play ill stick to console lol why is the muscly caveman wearing a fur bra why isn t insurgency sandstorm on this list watchdogs legion looks insane i m looking forward to that samurai jack game litrelly 2 games worth playing then honestly kinda disappointed the only thing i m getting is watch dogs and doom 1 khi b t kara ng h ng c p dc mic c a ch disintegration vader no disintegrations boba as you wish me here s about watch dogs legion mom i need ur viisa lmao currently searching a good game to buy and hearing about watch dogs can someone explains me what is jrpg and arpg please when i first saw those phrase about 10 years ago i thought jrpg is rpg that from japan and with a very unique play style turn based so for a long time people use jrpg to describe a game that is turn based and from japan arpg is simply action rpg but i heard that some interpret it as american rpg which differs from jrpg in the national factor once again i am asking for your financial support who ever disliked this video will die tloutloutloutloutloutloutloutloutloutloutloutloutloutloutloutloutloutloutlou ps5 where s half life 2 alyx cant wait for warzone i knew that the last of us 2 should be at 1th place i don t understand how people like the game doom that shit is trash ieatn ightmares because people have opinion no weeb shit true that the last doom i played was one of those situations where i picked it up because of the game always popping up on lists like this and people seemed to enjoy it and i tried hard to like it but just couldn t gameplay is fast paced and loud and violent which is cool but it was so goddamn repetitive i was bored as fuck after 30 minutes it s not worthy of any of my hard drive space woww destroy all human was a big chunk of my childhood i m glad i don t like anime games or else my wallet would always be empty my most anticipated game of 2020 is definitely madden nfl 21 where the fuck is harry potter magic awakening wheres hunt showdown i know its not particularly new to xbox and pc gamers but it ps4 on feb 18 my most anticipated in order 1 ff7 remake 2 p5 royal 3 cyberpunk 2077 4 ghost of tsushima 5 the last of us 6 resident evil 7 yakuza i m kinda iffy on the change in gameplay but i ll give it a shot as a fan of the series of course i have little games i m interested in like animal crossing fairy tail but these are the heavy hitters for me 2020 the beggining of a pirate dying light 2 seeya persona 5 royal fairy tail no 1 the last of us game really i mean ok it is a mid to good game but not the top one how do you like every game have you ever done a bad review lol thumbs up if you re watching this in 2021 can t wait for ghost of tsushima not a lot of these caught my eye really except for elden ring destroy all humans and r6 outbreak i am extremely excited for dying light 2 hype potato lover i liked the fist one but i hope the second one is better sorry man but that game was delayed indefinitely at least you have ghost of tsushima and cyberpunk you are the only one whose in my mind mann what s with dungeon defenders awakened who else hates anime shit games card games shit 10 02 watch out for eagle assassins creed stranded deep anyone ya kuu za not bloody ya ka za damn amerkan your pronunciation of english words are atrocious as well you must not be highly educated let alone educated glad ghost of tsushima is top 5 how about horizon zero dawn 2 watch dogs legion no mount and blade bannerlord 572 wallets disliked this video top games i m hyped for last of us part 2 cyberpunk 2077 ghost of tsushima at first i didn t think much about last of us but after videogamedunkey re stated his opinion on the game saying how the characters are very consistently written i have changed my mind on it i got the same list and don t forget doom eternal karnage this is my exact list except dying light 2 is missing 1 tlou2 2 dying light 2 3 cyberpunk 4 ghost of tsushima alan martin are you serious someones opinion made you change your mind try thinking for yourself dude i wish their was a new upcoming god of war because of how it ended my top 3 vampire the mascarade bloodlines 2 the last of us 2 cyberpunk 2077 im new to gaming one question do ps4 games need constant internet to play games on story mode offline help plz g williams only online trillie don thanks bro g williams depends on the games but most one player games do not the internet is good for patches mostly jebes909090 thanks alot karnage elden ring bru i just preordered all three waiting for dying light 2 cant waiiittt alan martin cool alan martin nobody cares how some game donkey channel made u change ur mind g williams no yes but there not exclusive to psn except for last of us 2 alan martin that was about u dooooom trillie don there g williams dude its 2020 get internet same what abt re3 i m with you on cyberpunk and ghosts of tsushima comrade sarunes yeah they re gonna make me go broke alan martin play the game and have your own opinion top games we re all hyped gor alan martin so you are that guy that bases your opinion on other peoples opinion you should try using the brain ff7 last of us 2 kerbal space program the king irishman willl be so happy tell them to make the pathless free for ps plus like every other fuckin game they made was if you re going to say to the choppa at least do it like you have a sliver of respect for arnold man not even an accent the last of us 2 and ghost of tsushima ok but who cares about ps4 when ps5 is coming out the uk is already a police state lol who are they trying to fool some of the games are already out bit on pc dying light 2 did he say nioh 2 twice yo i am already playing persona 5 scramble which is just amazing with new battle system and whole new places i m here for gta 6 lmao kinda sick of all the female heroes getting pushed in the games they just had to really fuck up beyond good and evil 2 they added some ugly nappy head hoe as the protagonist instead i won t be surprise if jade is not in the game or is the villain this will end up like bionic commando on the ps3 lol skull and bones betcha its gonna be delayed project s been running for 8 years and they seem to renew the whole thing yearly especially if ubisoft sg wants to keep sponging off the singapore govt s funds itll work in their best interest to delay it persona 5 for you is outsiders a 3 player by control or online you are pronouncing yakuza is so wrong cyberpunk 2077 will be the game of the year probably gonna get bloodline2 what s better than vampires is that it s placed in my state get to da chopper mlb those sports games are just the same game every year ya know like callout duty and assassin s creed godfall assassins creed vikings man we need project awakening predator hunting grounds seems like evolve crazy clams it s just dbd disturbing cactus o all the gameplay that keeps coming out looks trash one after another after another yet they still push games out that are no way close to a finished product and at full price plus the dlcs they push out after releasing there bs so another 200 to 300 ontop of what you payed when the game got released what about gta 6 you actually put the last of us over cyberpunk 2077 man you make your love for sony games quite obvious sitting here patiently waiting for biomutant the only non fantasy game is just another dumb baseball reboot cant developers make a realistic combat game for christ sakes predator is coming on my bday hell yeah preordered last of us part 2 today i cannot wait i haven t watched this yet but the last of us 2 better be in the top 5 elden ring release in 2020 is all i wish for other games i can just wait 2 years and buy when they re 20bucks on sales guys remember to cancel your 7 day free trail hunt showdown is finally on ps4 no mention that game is incredible that s no alternative world that s our hidden reality the illusion the only one i m hyped for this year is ghosts of tsushima a lot of weeb games disgusting i m looking

putzbeard hello i m happy for u supposedly not supposably how could you not want last of us 2 uuuuuhhhhh yea not me not a fan of it what year do you think elder scrolls 6 is most likely to come out yakuza yes please another re remake i personally dont care and dont want it silent hill 2 remake please i love ff series playstation classic i think this is going to be another trash like ff xvi sure i agree take the time needed to make the game great but god damn do the words delayed indefinitely sure feel like a kick in the dick gta 6 u forgot rust eat your cereal persona 5 royal in 28 thats a good joke dreams wheres rust hey the astros gave us a wooden horse let s put it in our dugout lol set up cameras in the other teams dugout lol sneaky shit lol in the new baseball game will be able to steal signs lol or i won t play lol what about biomutant ghost of tshushima i m going to get a ps5 first if you compare this list to the xbox list it shows that king sony is dedicated to bringing amazing games to the gamer why anyone would buy that shit box over the ps5 is beyond me yeah i wonder why some people buy shitbox than playstation all the anime games look trash elden ring what is that fromsoftware okay i m in mlb the show gtfoh lol i m looking forward to destroy all humans 2 i played the first but couldn t get past the part where i had to defend the radio tower no matter how many times i tried so i hope they give it options for easy medium hard lol can we see a hat in time 2 that d be sweet actually gta5 is number 1 right please you sound bored it may take a while but if lo2 comes on ps5 im buying it on that when one puts the last of us 2 above cyberpunk and doom eternal i just zoom out and go back to youtube s home page p carbon connection well you re definitely on your own the last of us 2 will be 2 leagues above cyberpunk and doom carbon connection yup your by yourself then because i m not a fan of first person shooters yeah let me run around with two hands all day dbz kakarot not dumb it s the laziest copy paste cash grab i ve seen in a while the last of us part 2 the last of us 2 resident evil 3 ghost of tutsima those are for sure in my library for 2020 resident evil 3 man nemesis the resident evil 2 remake was already amazing to me crusader junior hello last of us ii needs to release on pc like cmon i am watching on 240p and this video feels like 60 fps ffvii is the most overrated game of all time needs more japanese games and less generic safe bet games where is ninja gaiden 4 the real question for mlb 20 is will it tell us the pitch ahead of time the game will hit sometime this year nobody knows when it if will be released im not going to lie i hope yakuza like a dragon is only a one of the whole fun of yakuza in my opinion was the stupidly overpowered badassery of your character when he was taking on 30 people what about my hero s one justice 2 game is delayed give me likes please lol elden ring only 7th and where is tales of arise i hope that the new vampires will live up to it s predecessor the first game was one of the most complex crpgs of it s generation what is the background song that starts at 4 40 sounds awesome 8 28 pun intended what no system shock lol ive been waiting for wild for 6 years now that game aint coming man eater disaster report 4 the last of us part 2 ghost of tsushima battle for bikini bottom rehydrated destroy all humans journey to the savage planet two point hospital buildings have feelings too cyberpunk 2077 little nightmares 2 watch dogs legions also whatever cool stuff gets a limited run or red art games release brexit is a good thing no crew 3 what about rust gta 6 most of these aren t even ps4 games they re also on pc and xbox the ones that are just on ps4 are just anime jakuza trash you crazy i think dying light 2 i feel like im the onnly one who found doom boring as fuuuuuuck i would love a new skyrim 2 but the game is locked in 30 fps i m hoping for ghost of tsushima to come out in fall like they said idk when in fall how about bio mutant the only game i want is sleeping dogs 2 who watched the project sakura wars anime elden ring and yakuza 7 are pretty much my most anticipated at the moment disintegration looks like nothing else it looks like spicy destiny disintegration looks like nothing else it looks like spicy destiny what about rust disintegration is pure trash i wouldn t even waste your time doing a before you buy video so um just anime stuff rip my wallet if been waiting for wild for a min good to hear something on it i didnt like nioh i hated the loot system i want to find a new weapon and be like cool a new unique more powerful weapon in nioh you find lots of the same weapon but slightly different stats and have to waste tons of time reading the slight differences instead of playing the game you lose the satisfaction of finding something new with that system if the loot system was more like dark souls where every weapon was unique i would ve finished it but i only played for 10 hours before i couldn t stand it anymore good stuff falcon lego wow lego so fucking cool very fucking fun dragonball z kakarot seems amazing but theres so many dragonball games i dont even care about them all the same 14 24 this ain t it chief a predator game lol oh god man i member c games ps4 is slow af and shit it s not as fast as pc but still holds up well not including dying light 2 really saddened me martin les i think is because its delayed indefinitely spellbreak looking forward to ghost of tsushima and the last of us 2 agree thanks for putting the last of us 2 at no 1 fight night i like how ubisoft is making a game post brexit but said nothing during the immigration human trafficking crisis and the massive increase of acid attacks in london yeah good on you guys dreary knitpicker wtf does this have to do with gaming i m confused as well what s with all these remakes 2020 is the year of anime games why not overwatch 2 without doom this list has nothing that will actually come out or be good rust ghost of tsushima delayed 2021 the last of us 2 delayed winter 2020 i just don t know about ff7 like honestly if the developers them self don t know how many episodes there are and when they coming then it s best to wait it out for it all why play that sad gloomy song in the background ruins the video i lost my dog today and this makes me sad i was looking to distract myself this depresses me sorry for your lost want a new socom syphon filter me watching the whole video also me sees baseball game 30 seconds forward how y all finna forget wasteland 3 its funny that they didin put dyng light 2 because its being delayed but they put beyond and evil 2 that its coming with luck in 2022 i used to play beyond good and evil on game cube it was so good top ten 10 50 thank me later the fuck is an eye teration 6 26 ea sports ufc 4 i know it s nich but i m so pumped for it you should make a review on sly cooper wow dying light 2 is a bonus that s burnt hope we can play ps4 games on ps5 at 60 fps that s the only reason i don t use my ps4 ghost of tsushima looks awesome i m actually more exited for this than any of the sequels to games coming god s and monsters dbz kakarot good or evil 2 destroy all humans ghost of tsushima it s a complete waste on psvr number 1 the last of us 2 dying light i like 6 games ghost of tshushima i am looking forward to every game on this list except the last of us 2 lol i played through hours of the last of us just to have a crazy incident regarding my ps account leaving that account worthless and either starting over or giving up i gave up lmao that entrance sequence alone is too long to go through again the need a remake of final fantasy x omg that would be a killer honorable mentions samurai jack number 13 and still no destroy all humans mention oh wait my most anticipated game oh boy oh boy can t wait to see how many weeb ass subhuman games will be on this list my bet is 21 huh only ten what s going on gameranx we can all unsubscribe for you saying that way let s see how you are then we don t have a date yet i felt that pepe the frog that s so dumb i laughed we want to know whats happened imagine putting final fantasy above cyberpunk good grief i want the majority of these games which means i m going to have even more debt you d think the fact that i have a back log of like 20 games would stop me but nooo that s what i get for being a gamer i suppose i really need help when is mount and blade bannerlord coming out for console cannot wait for it why was spellbreak not here will someone please convince me to either buy dbz k wait until the price drops or just pass on it completely ryugo7 7 it s a great game great story free world roam couldn t ask for a better dbz game king wolfie i bought it earlier today about to fire it up i really want disco elysium out on the ps4 this year ghost of tsushima is actually suppose to come out in the summer not fall for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that who ever believes in him will not perish but have everlasting life for god did not send his son into the world to condemn it but that the world through him can be saved we are saved by grace through faith and that faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of god we must be willing to turn from sin to receive jesus forgiveness and to know and live out his teachings kjv nkjv love the videos but i m so tired of this background beat omg i dont want last of us 2 no bloodborne 2 last of us the most overrated game falcon you forgot the best dying light 2 april and may is killing it re3 ff7 tloup2 remake plague has hit the gaming industry wait fall i thought ghost of tsushima was set for summer 2020 im more hyped for ghost of tsushima than last of us cause that game is going to be a banger but of course i really want to play last of us 2 and cyberpunk why does no one talk about the spongebob remake it s

vegeta s final flash where s overwatch 2 at tho ahh damn thought this was an exclusives lists so a lot of these are gonna match the xbox one list sooooo good to be with sony fam i would play lego

cyberpunk 2077 ghost of tsushima and nioh 2 jonah santos you re missing out then one of the best games i played the 2 games i really want are most likely delayed lou2 how many persona games are there its like every game becomes dlc or something games of this list i will buy is resident evil 3 cyberpunk and the last of us 2 the rest of the games looks bad sorry cyberpunk 2077 last of us 2 ff7 i m calling it now either way it s a great year for games 11 41 sombra is that you xd vampire the masquerade was so good game back then that s a whole lot of games for 1 year i don t ever see xbox having this kind of line up holy jebus yo where is god of war 5 wild feels like it has been cancelled can someone tell me what skull and bones will be about because i haven t played assassins creed kinda skeptical getting these game if they re just gonna re release for ps5 is this only for ps4 i got xbox i was looking forward to last of us 2 but they had to ruin it and make the girl a lesbian to play these games you must survive coronavirus get to the choopaaaaa lol wait what watch dogs sometime this year is it not next week wheres dying light 2 still no nier automata these games exist my wallet chuckles im in danger dfasf waiting for last of us 2 cyberpunk 2077 doom eternal ghost of tushima nobody gonna talk about horizon zero dawn 2 i bet a 100 that dieing light 2 going to get delayd again i cant wait for the iast of us 2 to come out so small detail but star theory is no longer developing ksp2 it has gone back to private division squad star theory has not been heard from since at least october 2019 i knew the last of us part ii would be number 1 lmao dying light 2 how is that not on this list anything on rust to this day i don t understand why people go apeshit over the last of us why can t japan make their own skyrim game but samurai or ninja that would be great the only 2 major games i am looking forward are cyberpunk and last of us 2 destroy all humans got me hyped this is such a clickbait video the majority of these games dont have official 2020 release dates and the ones that do aren t exclusive get your shit together gameranks so doom re3 and last of us the other games suck falcon sounds depressed can you pls make the release date typing bigger almost everybody watches this video almost everybody s wallet chuckles i m in danger playstation vr is a joke compared to other hmd s even the oculus quest is more powerful i cant wait for persona 5 scramble game has cartoon art style everyone zelda botw ripoff dipzoid it looks exactly the same lol tf wallygator 2001 saying it looks the same is like saying cod looks like battlefield only nintendo sheeps are saying that dipzoid hello mostly nintendo fanboys were going on about it shadow of the colossus had a similar art style and that was 2005 it was a open world monster killing treasure hunt its a lot alike jochem de roo and botw didn t invent that jochem de roo that s a generic description that fits everything from monster hunter to shadow of the colossus althea mariz no pretty much fk in everyone is saying that eugen w chter well i can t tell the difference eugen w chter cod does look like battlefield or the other way around nintendo is shit they just keep releasing the same games people only play their games for nostalgia man no matter what people say i love this channel i dont see anyone saying anything negative but good for you champ enjoy it gnl 2006 hello kingrailz hello slade slay people say they are retardeds and stuff game exist me f ck my pc dude again you didnt mention dying light 2 even though there were games here with no release date so you cant use that as an excuse john rambo has been locked in quarantine the corona virus can t stop him and quarantine can t hold him rambo 6 quarantine rated r dragon ball z saga the dragon ball saga is very different to the dragon ball z saga don t confuse the two dragon ball is varsly superior top 30 ps4 xbox one pc games of 2020 there you go i fixed your title i didn t even think people actually cared about the ps s anymore huh you forgot snow runner title a mud runner game so where s the new games what about call of duty black ops 5 i won t support the predator game because of the way they did friday the 13th i wanna play the pathless let s just hope predator doesn t go down the road evolve did i am looking for to little nightmares 2 and little hope by dark pictures yaka what destroy all humans series was a lot of fun back in the day fingers crossed for the remake cyberpunk 2077 ghost of tsushima last of us ii yakuza 7 that s all i need lol i really wish they would release some more information on ghost of tsushima truly awesome games but i simply don t have the time to play that much anymore the last of us 2 is the only game that i m gonna play for sure why you don t have time so no dying light 2 who wants to break falcon s heart and tell him that if a game s release date says 12 31 2020 it s not coming out this year 31 12 2020 it s not coming out this year 2020 12 31 it s not coming out this year crisis averted xsubparsaucex hello wait 31 months is that new i only know 12 months xd136 no it s the european way of writing dates so it s d m y rather than m d y freya dk woooosh frothykibbles67 i thought he was making fun of the dude freya dk he was he was making a joke and it seemed like you didn t realize freya dk yeah i know but it is so confusing it doesn t make any sense why would you put the smallest in the middle and the middle one first but yeah americans also use the inferior imperial system have guns and think universal healthcare is communism still waiting for a prince of persia on ps4 or max payne ironman vr is probably going to be shit why no mention of biomutant is all of these games a valid reason looks like i m getting another external hdd i ll just wait for the ps5 drop this late holidays and get most of the games no animal crossing rip my backlog elder scrolls six reeeeeeeeeeeeeee if you didn t know which game was number 1 then sorry to say you arent a playstation fan they didn t have the fast and the furious game as number one i d put it wayyy above last of us 2 doesn t hold a candle to fast and the furious jk the predator game kinda looks like that one other game imo evolve was it i can t remember i think it looks way better though that alota games too bad i dont have ps4 this video is just falcon saying how could you not want this game who wants to play lego games seriously they re shit so do i pay my rent for 3 months or do i buy games y know what guys never trust game trailers god know when the game is released you ll get surprised of what actual game looks like i would pick doom eternal and ff viii remake just don t get your hopes up mate g day looking forward to a lot of these games but one in particular is skull bones it s like ac 4 black flag but 3 or 4 times better i m down with that it s got to be better than the joke that was sea of thieves sees cyberpunk in 3 place wait is there more i wonder if the oppressor mk3 will be in cyberpunk no only playstation people want last of us 2 you forgot too mention sword art online alicization lycoris you forgot subnautica below zero where dafuq is dying light2 c yakuza 7 is a new direction in the series i don t really know if they are gonna do spin offs anymore let me guess 1 cyberpunk 2077 edit im shook gg lego star wars the skywalker saga should have dlc set during the events of the mandalorian hm granblue above p5r despicable 7 48 can t say i agree the one thing that prevented me to fully enjoy ni oh 1 was the protagonist 12 35 define everyone 13 05 i don t really care about doom now to my list of this list 10 cyberpunk 2077 9 vampire the masquerade bloodlines 2 8 yakuza like a dragon 7 dragon ball z kakarot 6 the pathless 5 ghost of tsushima 4 p5r 3 nioh2 2 tlou2 1 ff7r something like that just do a remaster of demon souls already i can t be the only person that thought the last of us was just meh u forgot dying light 2 bruh horizon zero dawn i ve been waiting for but likely i hear tied to the new ps console to be released sometime next year bummer where is maneater you know the shark rpg game comes out may 22nd can y all do another before you buy for the division 2 plz wow th samurai is named eugene eye teration doom eternal is hitting sometime this year ummmmm dude it s coming out in under a month did you record this video in 2018 isn t in under a month sometime this year yakuza better not go with that direction why wasn t mount and blade bannerlord on here p p p p l l l falcon must be sick he doesn t have anywhere near the energy he brings to most videos either that or the audio was mixed poorly biomutant neo wasnt good my sure buy this year is hollow knight silksong if it comes out this year it should what s the game in the thumbnail ghost of tsushima take a shot of how many times these guys compare open world games to breath of the wild lol why ps4 only pls no hate you such a cute kid nazman rashid me nazman rashid u mean the profile pic dont u im sorry but who is playing freakin sports games so b o r i n g games i wish were release a new midnight club 28 days the getaway a new driver game fear and respect i can agree on the driver game but i d like for us to be able to get out of the vehicle like in one or two previous driver games and be able to continue driving or walking after we beat the game marcus porter agreed i like that the last one had real licensed cars i thought that was really cool is there any ww1 ww2 games mid gar not mid ger lmao not sure if they ll make changes in the future but new game plus is now paid dlc for yakuza 7 even though it s been free since all games since this game was already getting a bunch of backlash this is a stupid move on sega s part elden ring has no release date because just like gorge r r martin s books he cant finnish the story he literally only created the world the story and everything else is done by fs ricky rick i think he was making a joke i can t fucking wait for elden ring it s gonna be so dope also he s not as celebrated as you think i wonder what would an open world game from fs look like 10 24 marvel s ms marvel 7 25 it will be an open world grindy rpg designed to sell you boosts like every other ubisoft game get a computer please stop with these anime games bro they are all the fucking same sucks that we have to wait 2 years for god of war 2 and horizon zero dawn 2 top 30 new ps4 games of 2020 more then half are for pc and xbox one when i read the title i thought it meant games just for the ps4 it s high time we got kingdom of amalur reckoning on ps4 i m excited for watch dogs legion forgets rust where is dying light 2 wow nice rice farmer simulator clickbait hey guys i found something on metro exodus look at my video it turns metro exodus in to a full exploration game what about gta ghost of trushima we need a dragon s dogma sequel donnie bible this guy gets it shit id settle for a re 3 remake type of dd with smooth gameplay and graphics the last of us 2 old ass dated graphics i was really surprised tht rust wasnt in the list is elden ring coming out this year or in 2021 never mind then i just noticed that it is on the list honestly just came here to see if the last of us part ii was in first place the fact that the last of us comes out on my birthday just makes the game so much better how old are you nazman rashid 50 nioh 2 elden ring ghost of tsushima and cyberpunk 2077 will be all i need along with my fighting games for like the next 2 years lol then i ll get a ps5 i m personally looking forward to ghost of tsushima the fact he didn t mention the spongebob battle for bikini bottom remake makes me sad don t forget the dah remake people keep talking about doom and last of us 2 but i wan more excited for the first couple of games not really into those series nioh 2 last chance trial is out today feb 28 if you want to try before you buy it s on the psn under demos guys i need some games halfway through the vid wondering if i m just old now or what i don t give a fuck about a single one of these games it s been a few years of that for me now my ps4 is collecting dust gta v is still my go to relaxation time if i m gonna game and i had that game on 360 is last of us 2 coming still ff7 is dieselpunk not cyberpunk i heard something about a new saints row game coming out this year thoughts no it will be 2020 2021 we should just use the acronym p a w since ever game is set in a post apocalyptic world skull and bones where are you and ghost of tsushima i am waiting for you guys beyond good and evil 2 needs to be cancelled or rebooted from scratch numbers 2 3 and 4 for me i ve never been a fan of survial horror type games no words a destroy all humans remake that s great s callin bones lol last of us 2 i ve been waiting for so long played the first one like crazy on ps3 and ps4 i pretty much know the main story and the dlc from memory i really wish this game stands up to what the first game was really my fav game of all time no pressure thought it just ps4 games thumb down i would play the new watchdogs game if it wasn t so obviously anti brexit name of the first song 0 31 get to da chappa do it now falcon shouting to his gramranx colleagues while jake picks them off one by one still no new infamous entry elden ring disintegration vader no disintegrations boba as you wish kingoyouth hello mr falcon is everything alright with you i felt your voice a little down in this video hope everything is fine huge cheers from brazil sports games are real games can t release the exact same game every year to just make money you were so lazy talking about yakuza that didn t do even a single research for what it seems the game s already out for a while and despite not being in english yet you can easily see how good or not it is and if it is a sequel which it is or spin off its a shit excuse for a yakuza game im ignoring it as well 1 the last of us part 2 2 ghost of tsushima 3 resident evil 3 remake cyberpunk 2077 resident evil 3 watch dogs 3 dying light 2 the last of us 2 my must play games cyberpunk last of us 2 ghost of tsushima dbz kakarot those are the ones i want most not to make anyone sad but i have a strong feeling cyberpunk2077 will be delayed again until 2021 still no fight night or any good boxing game creed vr sucks and ufc isn t boxing i wish it played ps3 games i d be very interested to know why not make one even just remastering fight night champions would be awesome they re so nice i m almost starting to feel quite uncomfortable with this wow the last i heard of wild was years ago it still exists i hate how long before release all the games nowdays are advertised for it s impossible to care by the time it comes out ghost of thusima i really hope last of us brings back multiplayer pirate warriors 4 tales of arise mha2 pso2 ff7 remake and about just a few of the games listed here are what i m waiting for the most bro your channel is so irrelevant that you have to use ads to get views damn it tlou2 is coming out in my exam days avoid internet spoilers i know i will why should i spend money on these games when ps5 is coming out at the end of 2020 you will be able to play ps4 games on ps5 rec none of these games other than tlou look that great to me tbh a rebel with a cause true maybe i had a stroke but i thought elden ring was announced as an xbox exclusive did that get walked back or am i remembering that wrong rust trials of mana is looking great lots of games to look forward to and many many more fantastic games which aren t on this list i m liking this pathless game wild you missed dying light 2 according the sony my ps4 runed only 4 hours a month in last year and this list looks like it will be the same this year fighting geem cross genre geem geem it s game not geem what does jrpg mean why do ppl like first person shooters man i have tried some but really can t seem to like these i m sad about cyberpunk2077 also i just got to know ff7 in only for ps4 sad kanishak chauhan i fucking hate first person shooting games that s why i haven t played resident evil 7 i hate them with a passion what is the last of us god do these videos suck now so boring every single one is brimmed full of filler crap often it s repeated irrelevant info all just to stretch past 10 minutes just look at the videos i can t get past the 5 minute mark anymore i have not seen joel in last of us2 yet i am not hyped about that at all cyberpunk doom resident evil and soulslikes get my attention no mention of rust getting added to ps4 idk why ppl hate in anthem it is such a good game may 15th is my birthday i know where i am going with my tax money lol the biggest game i m looking forward to this year is cyberpunk 2077 i just wanna loose myself in one of my favorite genre of videogames and with the breadth of options from a deep rpg set in a world akin to only the likes of rockstar creations it s gonna be so dope last of us is a really close second for me and then ff7 remake and of course i m looking forward to ghosts of tsushima that game although not much info about it looks amazing and i love that period in japanese history samurai and ninja are so badass number one should ve been the ps5 this list plus warhammer miniatures will decimate my wallet xd ghost of tsushima will be out in summer not fall how can you get official information so wrong giving thumbs up for most inventive way of pronouncing yakuza 2020 the broke year wild is finally coming out x to doubt you should add m b bannerlord on the list you guys should and need to make the texts in the corner larger and more visible hell ya i hope everyone has a kick ass time playing all these awesome games in 2020 the predator game reminds me of the friday 13th game it drew inspiration from the game for sure but i m sure it ll be much better will the predator be able to evolve are you fckn serious the last of us 2 in first place lol idiotic top ok question why do you talk about all of these games like they are only coming out on playstation because i can tell you right now that not all of them are exclusive like lego star wars and destroy all humans for example was resident evil 3 even mentioned i kinda zoned out yep at number 5 give me god of war or horizon type why it had to be soles type ghost of tusima is greate the narrator doesn t know the definition of cult classic elder ring is souls based which means great story and hard i m an older gamer i want to play a game for fun and entertainment i am not interested in a game that has 10 hours of content but turns into 100 hours because you have to keep grinding on boss battles and repeat the same thing over and over because you die 1000 times i ll keep my money and watch play through s on youtube save myself the hours of stress and frustration i completely agree with you i like to play a game with lots of content that s fun but at times challenging when it makes sense for it to be but if a game is constantly hard and it s a chore to figure out how to pass each and every spot you encounter enemies it s annoying the harder it is the greater the reward when you beat it lows in life make highs feels so much better this is why many like these games chap hammersmith that s cool i understand that but not for me lol cyberpunk was held back because these consoles from 2013 are incredibly out dated and instead of just releasing it on pc only first like tons of games do for console they re going to downgrade it even more than they probably already have just look at some of the first trailers for the witcher it looked stunning but since current gen was clearly not as powerful as it was made out to be we got what we got i feel like half of the games were anime animes awesome streets of rage 4 where is the dying light 2 cyberfunk i would expect a video titled top 30 new ps4 games of 2020 to only have ps4 games i guess top 10 wasn t attention grabbing enough bro spongebob bfbb rehydrated this video exists the funds in my bank account extinct the ghost is coming in the summer man would i enjoy persona 5 if i m not into anime any ideas not fan of cyberpunk and doom not my type this year is so fkin barren in terms of games a lot of games delayed for the consoles and maybe 4 or 5 significant games sad like 30 of these games youve gone over at least once already in the last month alone just make the list shorter okay maybe more like 70 holy shit guys just make the list shorter i have never thumbs downed one of your videos but this has got to stop a significant part of these games will most likely not be released in 2020 new ps4 games 2020 may be out in 2021 hmm ghost of tsushima ff7 re3 cyberpunk persona dying light where the f is ps5 i love your content here on this channel but guys come on dont say best games coming to ps4 this year then show a ton of multiplatform games and more then 1 game with literally no release date that s super click baity and not cool you should stick to exclusives for these lists with release dates then do a multiplatform list with release dates then a tba games lol yes i said it that way and no there is nothing you can do about it final fantasy 7 remake cyberpunk 2077 ghost of tsushima that s all for me i dont wanna spend too much but i ll just get last of us 2 correction about star theory for ksp 2 actually start theory dissolved and it went back to private division and that s a good thing final fantasy vii set in mid ger according to our friend falcon i just love how he pronounces things sometimes hilarious wait so the game is not really completed like it s only till some part ntshiyosa 922 yeah the first installment will probably have you just in midgar the original game was pretty vast in its own right having 3 disc in the original playstation there s a lot you can do in the original as well as varying events depending on certain circumstances there s also hidden backstories characters you can discover along the way and optional bosses so there s a lot to develop if they want to be truthful to the original i was really hoping all the games were gonna be made in dreams as a joke some of these games are also coming to xbox 1 bruh destroy all humans is the best smoking weed game ever do you guys remember evolve yuh koo zah that s al daniel rollins thank you daniel rollins hello hes just saying it how it would be pronounced in japanese how is dying light 2 not even in the top 30 because it s getting delayed indefinitely i want horizon zero dawn 2 but there s so much good stuff this year i recon they won t announce until end of this year me too they just left a cliffhanger about what sylens said to hades core someone far more powerful than this little core who could revive some massive titanic machine ff7 looks great but not knowing how long theyre gonna drag this out doesnt set well with me super hyped for cyberpunk i can t wait till september almost every single one of these games is going to be on all systems why would you tag it as ps4 quit hyping like ps4 has all the games predator game doesnt have arnold swfsdljfrnger that s disappointing thanks gameranx for reminding us all that our bank accounts are going to be 0 all year hahahaha forgot most of the games on the list but now i remembered them all thanks to this what my money says to each other good bye everybody i ve got to go most of these are passable maneater is missing digimon survive isn t getting much love anywhere i dont see too much being announced strictly for playstation seems like a pretty balanced year for xbox and playstation ff7 and tlou ps4 games a lot of those looked like they aren t exclusives he means games that you can play on ps4 he didn t say exclusives the best upcoming games list all year no samurai jack u seem to will be there for alot of these titles what about horizon zero dawn 2 midgur surprised you didn t say more to nemmy being more deadly than mr x guess your not to worried i sure will get the yakzua game that hair grin smile can the anime gtfo and show some games which actually have good graphics with some actual effort i m not saying anime art dosent take effort i m saying that making 3d games with rdr2 graphics are way harder to make and should be on this list i hope a lot of these are coming to the new xbox i don t really care a console is a console but i will say that i think xbox has the superior controller in many aspects especially comfort wise the pathless looks amazing predator hunting ground the last of us 2 ghost of tushima gameranx 20 mlb is a game people are excited about people nope whenever i start to think of trading towards an xb1 these types of videos upload and snap me out of it not knocking xb1 but all these exclusives wait is destroy all humans gonna have updated voice work i thought john cygan passed away he voiced the general trying to capture crypto and solidus snake you have alot of how cant you want insert titel which is hallerious to me as i can easly say doom eternal and last of us 2 is deffently games i wont be gettng if dying light 2 does get released in 2020 i m anticipating it could be the best game of the year so we just gonna ignore battle for bikini bottom rehydrated re3 remake vampire game cp 2077 and maybe ff7 remake i have my doubts about it was in japan on the release of yakuza like a dragon it s called yakuza 7 there or ryuu ga gotoku 7 it s turned based which has put people off a little the game is apparently well made and fun but takes a huge step in a different direction apparently you ll see kiryu and or majima at some points in the story too but otherwise you can probably jump into the game fresh as it s a new story so many game so little money watch dogs legion post brexit future does this mean this game is deliberately anti brexit suggesting the unrest is to do with britain leaving the eu or showing how corrupt our politicians are to the length of ignoring the vote to leave by enslaving the people from 11 39 not a single white english person in london well at least they got the london demographic down to a t darkest dungeon 2 sad there was no mention of this dreams is just an advanced roblox prove me wrong best games last of us 2 legion ghost of thutshima and cyberpunk yo do you play tlou icy a yes online icy a no last of us is way overrated doom eternal the resident evil 3 nemesis remake and the last of us 2 go run get to the chopper lol let s make this comment the most liked in the comment section because i am begging for likes beyond good evil 2 is that still coming out brilliant i am not getting cyberpunk i bet it will be similar to the division the graphics wont be as textured and detailed and it will get boring fast it s just super hyped up for years idk i am skeptical with games these days give me doom eternal and tlou2 tho it is pronounced ghost of tooshima not sushima no it s not the t is silent like in tsunami you can look it up yourself if you don t believe me i m a lying gamer every time i buy a game console i say to myself that i will not buy anything new until i finish everything i have so many great games so not much time to play them all 30 games on this list and the only 2 games i m looking forward to aren t even on it retromania maneater days gone or rdr 2 which one should i buy please tell me i am totally confused rdr2 treefiddytwo y bro treefiddytwo days gone damn so no mention of godfall smh it looks like it ll be great tbh godfall is not a ps4 title i cant wait for the new one piece pirate warriors to come out this year elden ring is gonna have a lot of floppy weiners in it dreams is like a roblox wanna be so predator is basically a refined evolve no dates for barely anything dying light 2 dying light 2 oh its in bonus part nvm destroy all humans yes how is no one comparing cyberpunk to deus ex no horizon zero dawn i m good literally almost every game has been delayed this year thats a good thing i know that but that s also a negative adam othman how if it means the game will be better thomas hoogeveen i know that it means we get a better game i m just saying i wish that the game would come out earlier but i don t mind when a game gets delayed plus i can t really afford these games right now because i don t have a job yet do you have a list of climbing games i m hyped about genshin impact for the climbing no snowrunner come on guys thank god all the games i interested in also available on pc no need to buy ps4 or godforbid xbox i ve heard sony wants to release some exclusives for pc starting with horizon zero dawn so are you just never going to make a video on the photo mode in different games why am i watching this i cannot even own a ps4 meanwhile on switch a load of old ass games or something with mario or zelda in it still had the highest ranked games tho svissmail dotnet ranked in what lol l s successor well metacritic to begin with svissmail dotnet yeah games that came out about half a year to 10 years ago i m surprised people paid 400 to play a mario game guess i m no where near how rich they are and the fact that a mario game cost a whopping 60 as much as a aaa game that s some bullshit right there game doesn t even worth anywhere over 10 rith panhapich dude just stfu mario games deserve 10 times the price of trash like cod it s a bit funny because the games you say is basically impossible to not look forward to like persona 5 and elden ring are the games i really really don t care about what dying light 2 only gets an honourable mention h e r e s y 3 the last of us 2 2 the last of us ii 1 the last of us part 2 i hope skull n bone is a single player game with cool multiplayer function halo infinite what about minecraft dungeons it comes in 2020 all that anime shit yikes what is the difference between falcon and eagle this dude is sooooo horney for playstation im soo excited for outrider and cyberpunk you have to say choppa as stated by law i love turn based battle system with a passion and i support it cause modern gaming hunts it down to a point where its belongs with the endangered species but man oh man yakuza 6 doesnt belong there it just feels wrong i hope it sells good though ori wasnt good enough for the list no 1 the ps5 is it just me or all or almost all like half these games are ps4 exclusives just saying 2k21 will be one of the best selling games of this year when it comes out and it doesn t even make this list when you go above 10 or 15 it s not really a top video considering the amount of games that will be released this year that weren t mentioned it easily could be meanwhile at xbox we just bought 40 more studios and exclusives are coming 2 exclusives per generation for your knowledge microsoft will release 3 exclusives in march only ooniii chaaan yeah shitty ones hope you know not all the games mentioned here are ps4 exclusive right okeh bru well i talked in numbers not quality of the games idiot dont need exclusives i play online games and i like the better controller and ui on xbox most hyped for ghost of tsushima looks amazing and i can t wait same here as long as it has good stealth and a good story i am gonna be all over that better than nioh 2 bruh its march n these games still didn t come out i m just looking 4 ps5 games now fucc datt me 2 at first i was hyped about cyberpunk but now with the multiple delays i don t even bother anymore i will buy a ps5 and play the games i have until the 5 comes out i will also buy the new xbox looks cool the only game that rivals tlou2 possibly greater in terms of anticipation stig lauren i don t think the initial line up for the 5 will be worth not buying new games for the 4 i made that mistake with the 4 when it first came out time thean kotze hello fucc datt ps4 and ps5 games will be compatible lol they will prob release a ps5 edition for bunch of these games like they did with the previous renxo d maybe for u but overall no it s a follow up to a critically acclaimed masterpiece and ghost is new also remember their most recent game infamous second son it wasn t that great so i m not nearly as excited as tlou2 because every recent game from nd has had unrivaled quality now being released in june stig lauren multiple delays it was delayed from april to september that s the only time it has been delayed looks good but gameplay looks like ass yeah it looks great gerrit bosch mmmmmm very good points i guess ill just wait and compare after playing both games before making a final judgement worth trying some of these for sure i must say gods and monsters skull bones cyberpunk are the games i m most hyped for wild may also be interesting last of us 2 eh maybe wish we had a new rockstar game releasing this year i m triggered by how he says yakuza yes it s ya cooze uh everyone knows that yes i m like wtf every time he says it actually i think the focus on the a rather than the u is correct that seems to be consistent with other japanese words too although i am not an expert crazy friend productions he thomas kingsley troupe japanese people pronounce it as the man is this video does then you must be as smart as my hamster thetruthwillout well shoot that s one to grow on how has no one mentioned bio mutant that game looks funnnnnn so of the 30 biggest ps4 games more than half are multiplatform nothing more than a non descriptive cgi trailer or a yearly baseball game you re right this is gonna be a huge year for ps4 i am once again asking for your financial support when u say yakuza is a jrpg turn based why do u not say that for persona i have neva played persona but isn t that turn based too capt tsubasa rise of new champ at this point i m waiting till the ps5 is finally revealed i wouldn t might as well stay on ps4 a few more years and wait for the ps5 price drop or if they decide to update the launch model ah yes the industrial city of midger in ff7 always thought it was midgar yno the small the number the more i get goosebump let s play spot the japanese games elden ring i saw it on amazon the release date stated around july or june 30 or something around that time it s adorable that you think wild is ever coming out lol a whole lot of anime bullshit this video contains even the flower brigade will not make me buy a sony the ps4 lives on cyberpunk not 1st thats weird amazing last of us 2 cyberpunk ghost of tsushima watch dogs legion i m just pissed that more than half of the games coming out are still tba donovan hancock hello the title should be top 30 new game of 2020 the amount of ps4 exclusives is pretty low why is the so many anime titles 3 48 granblue fantasy vs looks cool but i m still waiting on the rpg hearing that it switched teams without any word or development news afterwards kinda scares me though i really hope it didn t get canceled i am in no rush to play the last of us 2 just not my bag don t forget insurgency sandstorm for those that don t know about that underrated game on pc it s like another call of duty battlefield style game yass dah this list will make playstation great a gain already preorder tlou2 as always shitty games u buggin probably the best lineup i ve ever seen at least 5 bangers and 1 banger equals 1 3 months of my after work life soooo i m kinda excited william form nioh lol all i could think of while stands around slack jawed while others talk is he could have been a custom character wow all the good games are ps4 o o what game is the thumbnail ghost of tsushima treefiddytwo thanks rip to all of our wallets my playstation fam 2020 the broke year hey gameranx where s that capture mode video lol dude said midger when talking about ff7 i don t see wild releasing this year it s a much bigger version than persona 5 you forgot to mention that it is censored and catered to resetera very disappointing that granblue fantasy is a ps exclusive adam why is it censored if cyberpunk gets delayed again an angry mob will storm cdpr s studios and demand it be released and if the uk ever becomes a police state it won t be because of brexit it will be because of ultra left wing and pc politics i need elden ring i love this channel and i don t want to push any buttons here but the watchdogs game looks like a dog whistle of sorts brexit isn t going to cause a future police state just wanted to throw that out there top 30 switch games video gods and monsters is to breath of the wild as battle of olympus was to the adventure of link also say gravity then say gravcycle kinda ticked off by the amount of games on this list of wich you guys no nothing in terms of releasedate stick to the video title please need dying light 2 in 2020 i still play destiny 1 and 2 ok no body i ll shut the door last of us is shit i dont know why it is on numer one i think you re forgetting about ghostrunner that game has the potential to be a huge hit and it looks fantastic i think the video cut off before you guys said the secret number 0 the spongebob remake haha its ok ill wait for the reupload i don t know about last of us 2 the first one was short if last of us 2 will be a open world then yes i will buy it hey i know xbox usually isn t the popular choice but could you guys do an xbox version of this video too maybe even games that aren t exclusive to any console as well 2 15 i am so far beyond hyped for this game it s not funny abz and it s predecessor and inspiration journey are my favourite games i m just watching and am like ya the last of us part 2 that s a familiar game and i m definitely getting it the rest i m like my wallet is safe samurai jack what the game in the thumbnail what is so silly in ff7r scenario ghost of tsushima is the only game that really piques my interest same yh man i m hyped af for it tbh what about the pathless and honestly same all these games are so garbage it s just mindboggling how one can hype up a game theyve been playing for years hmm yes indeed same here nothing seem interresting in all this sh t i feel i am gonna play skyrim and mass effect 2 and fallout new vegas for 2020 i m not actually surprised that a lot of the upcoming games are inspired from gore occult practices wiccan norse ancient egypt and greece vampires zombies and demons this world i will play something else what about maneater somethings throwing me off of cyberpunk 2077 feels like it might flop game exists falcon how could you not want this even if it s a mobile game even if it s knack local man does everything it takes to talk positively about every game mild satire it s a mastapiece super nova rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr raid shadow ledgends jazzy cant say that about sonic forces about 90 of the time hes not wrong thavisay sisamout maybe 80 venkat nikhil no that is where you are wrong its all about that knack toooo babyyyyy mild satire what do you mean even tomascomo estas even adverb used to emphasize something surprising or extreme you would know that if you stayed in school kid mild satire don t be toxic i was making a joke by even i meant why wouldn t you play it you just didn t have context how about next time you go though comments being toxic you think about what you re writing before you write it down online i know what the word even means i m not stupid but he s not wrong tho unless it s anthem so far it has been a very disappointing year for gaming paying playstation for nothing woah ive never heard of pathless but this game looks fucking dope i just don t like the midget character in elden ring wtf is that deformed dwarf lol justin that s darron everyone my wallets finna dieeeeee me ksp 2 and im happy bonexone fans rrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee pc leet fans chill daddy stay blessed i m still waiting for tales of arise and tales of crestoria since forever yakaza waiting for ps5 exclusive games tlou part2 and ghost of t 15 34 and 15 36 that confuses me for a moment remakes remakes remakes after watching netflix dragon quest wish we have dragon quest 5 remake mount and blade 2 bannerlord ghost of tsushima resident evil 3 remake ff7 remake and the last of us 2 watch dogs legion march 6 add midgar to the list of words falcon can t pronounce i want gta san andreas remastered i don t i absolutely fail to see the appeal of doom at all however i hope everyone who likes it enjoys it a lot cyberpunk that ironman game looks fun pc will have so many more i am seriously excited for cyberpunk 2077 but the vid got me excited for a few other games now to cyberpunks still at the top but now i know what else to look forward to thanks for the info should i be insulted that the embassy in britain from watchdogs legion that got blown up was canadian banzeye gaming hello wild is finally coming out x to doubt for some reason i remember playing this as a kid yeah its has been coming this year every year for like the last 5 years sub donate or gtfo xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx grand theft auto 20 will be out before wild it s coming out with bannerlord and star citizen square to doubt mcarnold richard sgravytrain hello nik gaming and more that s for xbox travis its actually for both but the thing is they are talking about the left button which is square on ps x pathless was the one by the journey and abzu guys correct this is looking a bit like sotc and i like it you are way too optimistic for all of these games pffft doom eternal not even top 5 you re cracked what why did dl2 got delayed also indefinitely wtf total rata i know it s ridiculous you asked about persona 5 who broke this guys heart before he recorded the audio for this homie ussually sounds so pumped and excited and this episode sounds sad af thanks for helping me opening a amazing contact thanks a lot my wallet chuckles i m in danger no half life alyx the state of gaming is sad once normies got into gaming it really decreases the quality of games last of us 2 i am fully content with ff7r and ff7r alone so much political correctness and all that bullshit infuriating ghost of tsushima looks good tho i really hope your not alone in tsushima i want to fight alongside other samurai 33 persona 1 2 3 4 5 is absolute garbage is it true willd is gonna be released this year i ve been waiting for that game since 2016 and one of the reasons i bought a ps4 news about it is slow please confirm it doubtful umm rust stranded deep the forest second son green hell subnautica below zero i m super hyped for cyberpunk 2077 and last of us part 2 but i m yearning for arkane studios to make a dishonored 3 game also for persona 5 you can have the chance to fight p3 and p4 s hero that is what i am most excited for i didn t know beyond good and evil is playstation exclusive game the predator game doesn t look isometrical at all also play this at 1 25x speed those pauses are long and many resident evil 3 remake 3 delicious finally lego games are now more smoother than the other star wars lego game on xbox the old version of xbox on this list the only game that interests me that isn t tlou2 is ghost of tsushima as i ve always enjoyed a good game that involves stealth september 4 is my birthday why did you let him say midger you must have editors who have actually played the game and know how to pronounce it there a few here that peak my interest 2020 is much more exciting waiting for what ps5 has up its sleeve as an old gamer am at that point were am only looking forward for just a few game nothing really gets me hyped anymore now i know how people waiting for half life 3 feel cuz i am waiting for fable 4 to be announce and nothing has happen half life alyx i m all about cyberpunk 2077 there is no dying light 2 really i am unsubscribing now i was subscribed for so long but this seems lol cool you mispronounced streets of rage 4 15 39 you say watch dogs legion is releasing some time time this year when it s literally coming out one week after this video was posted no it s not adam hearts this video was released on 28 february watch dogs legion is releasing on the 6th of march surely you can figure out what i m saying here unless you re a total dullard sockisradical except it s not releasing on march 6 adam hearts yes it is sockisradical well let the audience decide who is right sockisradical well today is march 6th how is that game playing it s just great adam hearts sockisradical sweet post some game play footage we d love to see how it plays will do adam hearts sockisradical sure thing we ll be waiting still waiting my video will be uploaded sometime around the 31st of december as i take a long time to edit these 40 hour videos thanks for your support adam hearts sockisradical ooohh the truth comes out uhhh is there anyone waiting on biomutant other than that i only care about ffvii the last of us and re3 i hate fps but still might get cyberpunk not one racing game game companies really gotta make some good arcade racing games i bet there s a high demand for it it feels like the genre is dying down due to the greed of companies to make as much money as they can from action games these days your so right i miss the old days of gaming where socom and killzone first came out that yakuza pronunciation though ghost of tsunami cyberpunk last of us 2 oh boy bloomberg ads are the new raid shadow legends ads you guys are funny saying ps4 new games there s some multi platforms in your list so many games releasing and so many games i already have which are due to be completed and some even downloaded cyberpunk and biomutant oh and you can fly to food if you want to shoot lasers out of your hands you can go do that now for free mdc online hand blaster is a common starting weapon i m looking forward to insurgency sand storm the only good games i think there were was kerbal space program 2 cyberpunk and tlou 2 it s gonna suck when one of these games get delayed until next year yes i said when not if devs don t even know when to release their games anymore what is the game in the thumbnail i was waiting for tlou2 to be on the list when it wasn t second place i knew it was gonna be first place there is no way you can talk about games of 2020 and not bring up tlou2 black mesa finally officially releases march 5 2020 gimme dying light 2 there s also samurai jack battle through time said to be released in the summer thanks dev hehe no seriously im gonna check what is it about thanks every games seems like a rpg i love it we got games everyone in comments fuck my wallet gonna have a high fever me nice good thing i saved around 4k 5k of cash so i m totes gonna have the nicer life dude i had no idea dying light was delayed indefinitely that s a big bummer tbh i absolutely love when games get delayed because it means they give a shit and wanna give us the best product plus my wallet gets to survive a little longer i stopped buying games on release a couple years back because they all felt too incomplete for 60 treefiddytwo i hope it turns out great unfortunately even if games do get delayed because of the development hell they went thru they might still come out shitty treefiddytwo i think they are delayed because they want to release them on the new consoles maybe they get some financial incentive for it how do you explain so many games getting delayed all at the same time for next year or close to next year non of them are my favorite some time we need simple adventure game with new creative ideas and it can be 4 play is no one gonna mention twd saints and sinners where are we suppose to watch sony this year since there not attending e3 again in english it s pronounced yahkooza in japanese it s pronounced yahkooza this guy has his own special way of saying it which is somewhat painful to my ears the true game on top is cyberpunk get to the choppah falcon you can t shoot lasers out of your hands you silly bird what about rust elden ring hard to see how it could go bad guess you dont remember kingdom of amalur i want to play resident evil one but remade like these new ones are another useless franchise is final fantasy makes zero sense release date is barely readable as long as the tsushima dont need to do some bullshit broken parry system resident evil are bad games besides 7 so when is biomutant gonna drop tho tales of arise lego game why even if i was 7 years old id say that is hacky dying light 2 needs way more attention and love was that a female predator i am intrigued pleasw dont acknowledge sports games they are just a repetative shell that updates every year and insulting to all gamers world wide if you wanna play soccer go outside and play if you cant physically do so play something cool soccer games are straight fucking garbage disintegration had an open beta not too long ago and it was super fun you flew around on a gravcycle ordering around 2 4 ground troops depending on your class and they were how you had to compete objectives good variation between classes and the troop controls actually worked well final fantasy 7 remake trials of mana and cyberpunk 2077 these 3 are my most anticipated also tales of arise i hope it s coming in 2020 no mention of trials of mana means gameranx knows nothing about games games looking at me me looking in my wallet my wallet get a job bitch where are the biased political comments from falcon fairy tail rpg 20 march 2020 i feel like i m the only one who cares and i care so much there s souch wrong in this video wtf no biomutan remove cyberpunk and add trials of mana suposubly spelled supposedly that one is my pet peeve lol how about how he pronounced midgar cornlips 4 hello dying light 2 not in top 25 that s bull soulsborne soulslike or whatever you want to call it genre it s an action rpg for fvck s sake why do you people glorify it like it s a totally different genre it s just another action rpg with gameplay features popularized by fromsoft or should we categorize every turnbase tactical rpg that uses summons as a final fantasy genre see my point it s ridiculous chris skywar sounds like you re taking this personally you mean like metroidvania or doom clone yeah real crazy this is true though they are making dumbshit for no reason stick it with the real one so should we stop saying 3rd person shooters and 1st person shooters are different when you boil it down they re both just shooters i guess beat em ups should just be considered a fighter as well since thats literally all it is jinx dexxter you got the point wrong from the start see you already assumed that soulslike is already a genre by comparing it to 1st person shooters these subgenres are created because perspective is a major difference in games however souls game have no notable difference in other action rpgs tell me what notable difference did souls games have that warrants a new subgenre did people created a different genre for games that introduced summoning mechanics did people create a genre for games that involve crafting no as someone who played these games enough to platinum them just adding my credentials so no one would said i didnt play the game i dont see enough reason for a subgenre chris skywar i think soulsgames stand for games that when you die you loose all your souls and need to get it back while all monsters in the map respawn but yeah in the end it s a action rpg forgottenshinobi11 no u think a soulslike game refers to an action rpg game with a very high difficulty chris skywar perspective isnt that major of a difference in games like you make it out to be most games that can be done in 1st person can still easily be done in 3rd person thats why there are more than a handful of games that do have both 1st and 3rd person gameplay and can easily swap between the 2 there a things that make soulslike games different just like jrpg has its own differences but i dont see you arguing that jrpg shouldnt get classified as its own subgenre you throwing credentials out when no one asked for them is sounding like you didnt platinum them it also sounds like youre completely hating on the souls games so many gamers have been vocal about seeing the souls games being of a different subgenre than regular rpg jinx dexxter slow down i said the credential because i dont want anyone bringing up i hate the game or i didnt play the game so i dont have any right to say anything but i see that it had the opposite effect now trying to shift the topic to something more personal the point here still stands rather than disproving the other examples you should give something that defends soulslike as an actual genre and btw perspective might be a simple thing and is easy to integrate in the game but perspective changes a lot not just in games but is applicable in almost everything as for jrpg i do think the term rpg is enough and it is a lot closer with the anime vs cartoon issue which i usually answer with my pizza argument but it s a totally different issue that would make my long ass comment longer and irrelevant dont misunderstand i like the games but there really isnt enough to make a new genre out of it if you think having an action rpg that drops your money when you die is enough for a new genre then ok so be it in most rpgs combat isnt solely based on managing stamina the witcher fallout horizon diablo all action rpgs none of them are remotely similar when tons of games start to copy every single element of one franchise then it s kind of become it s own thing final fantasy 7 remake of course i don t like the last of us i m now prepared to die i never finished it either got it for free with my ps4 bundle just didn t like it is resident evil3 coop online so basically every game that has released this year is on the list again with dbz kakarot that game was meh at best ubisoft has no current plans to release beyond good and evil 2 in 2020 we should expect the game to launch in april 2021 that s it i m buying a ps4 fuck xbox i ll just have both i m missing out on too many games as someone with only a pc this list makes me half sad i ve heard that sony wants to bring ps4 exclusives to pc first one will be horizon zero dawn i really wish kakarot was different man im tired of the same old shit from dragon ball games at least world seeker had new story on it predator hunting grounds cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool elden rings lol i ve never played a persona game should i 75 of these games are on the past couple lists you ve made if you re going to make a list of mostly cross gen games coming out chose different ones or just make one list i don t need to watch the same video 3 times place 30 1 ff7 remake the first game i have ever played and played through over 30 times and got me into games i still cannot believe they are remaking this and i m counting days since the announcement man i m waiting for spongebob battle for bikini bottom rehydrated lol i miss the years when demos where a thing sure did make me buy more games i m half half with this list i mean they put persona 5r below dragon ball z kakarot whats up with that my ps4 broke today last time you mentioned it you said lego star wars will be on switch this time you did not you do this a good bit actually 0 44 bewbieees i am shockingly immature pathless looks so freaking good will probably buy that one that and doom eternal so i can play it blind i hope the gameplay of the last of us 2 isn t like the first i thought the gameplay was the worst part of it anyone does arnold s voice is priceless everytime lol last of us 2 ghost of tsushima and dying light 2 can t wait for those games wtf is midger great games on both ps4 and xbox one coming this year doom and cyberpunk are must buys but i might wait for the series x upgrades to play them no more about the grappling shotgun plz can t wait for tlou2 always look forward to these videos this channel is the shhiitt dbz kakarot is great i m only waiting for watch dogs elden rising s hype reminds me of the same hype that kingdoms of amalur garnered hopefully the outcome isn t the same it s incredibly difficult to imagine which game would turn out bad i know no game or developers perfect but this is from fucking software we re talking about they wouldn t let themselves make trash and they sure as hell would not let themselves ruin their reputation no god of war where s dying light 2 this list is shit there are only about 5 games that will be worth playing no hollow knight silksong wtf lol it s probably coming later on the ps4 than the switch like the first one i m not sure ghost of tsushima is being released anytime soon or if it will even arrive as i ve pre ordered the game a year ago tbh i just want some damn elden ring gameplay granblue versus did you all just mention that game i want news about granblue relink you all know the game with the amazing 30 minute demo from around 2 years ago for crying out loud cyberpunk is number 1 last of us 2 is nothing compared to cyberpunk and ff7 wow you guys mad a list without a bunch of anime trash on it good job i truly hope that this will be our year guys d dude 2020 is out to get my wallet last of us 2 huh jeez i really need to buy and play the first one i want rust on ps4 lets be real here the only game on this list worth getting for your moneys worth is dreams this game is the fruityloop studio of games and should be worth 100 imagine the potential to create all the games on this list with just one game highly slept on game i hope we get some news about biomutant soon as well as more dying light 2 i know techland is doing 4 week 5th anniversary events for dl1 i can only hope something new comes up at the end of week 4 for dying light 2 lets face it we all knew tlou2 was no1 lego game really i m looking forward to yakuza 7 in english to understand ir slightly better and to undo mistakes i made e g use less night queen and unlock all job heat actions sooner dude i m so over dark souls you want dark souls just play it does every friggin game or at least what you featured have to be some souls like rip off nioh 2 and elden ring so 2 30 there will be plenty of non soulslike games that wild game there is no point in releasing it ever heard of far cry primal wtf is ctos doom eternal should be out march 20th this man is obsessed with his grappling hook shotgun dyllon brenner alllmoooooosssstttt i mean how could he not be ive been playing video games for the better part of like 25 years now and my jaw dropped when i saw that grappling shotty arent we all no straight roads they never mention this game and im so excited for it anyone else excited for it nevahardofit buntinjb yes that d i ve been waiting for it but haven t heard anything yet me knowing they saved the best for last my ps4 pro is so dusty havnt turned it on in months been playing on pc last time i turned the ps4 on it was telling me to subscribe to psplus again its just not worth it anymore imo plus theyre still making most games at only 30fps they have to make 60fps the standard next gen stop the focus on upscaling and focus on stable 60fps i have a feeling we will have assassins creed 10 at 12k upscaled but still only 30fps with dips in lower 20s the devs just dont seem to get it everyones tv monitor supports 60hz fps why focus on upscaling to tvs most people dont have yet stable framerate is much more important another reason i think why theyre focusing more on resolution is because a lot of console gamers dont understand how important hz framerate is or even what it does exactly they just want the best graphics because thats all they know so the devs are just giving what the majority are asking for i guess what about the next farcry or assassins creed series ubisoft had announced that they might release a sequel of any of these 2 games this year starfield still don t have a ps4 but my pc is ready not sure about my wallet though the only game i m looking forward too is skulls and bones been waiting for years for a good pirate game lilmanmf what no cyberpunk no tlou 2 doom eternal ff7 p5 royal man you have a extremely weird taste in games my bad highlights i m also am 34 years old and been wanting to play a pirate game that s not easy or a stupid money grab like most mobile games i really do miss pirates of the burning sea lilmanmf fair enough but nothing else interests you also have you played assassins creed 4 that s better pirate game than most pirate games my bad highlights yes i did i i did everything you could do in that game lol but i am actually disappointed in the assassin creed franchise right now on the other hand i dont like co op type games i haven t tried cyberpunk yet so i might actually get that one honestly though jrpg are a dime a dozen just my own viewpoint there was only one ff game that i liked and it was 10 never finished it because someone ruined the ending and i couldn t bring myself to finish it lilmanmf hmmm fair enough you played witcher 3 it s the success that allowed cd project red to make cyberpunk if you haven t you should definitely try it although it isn t very piratey but skellige sort of is my bad highlights i played witcher 3 loved the story just sucked at the monster battles not my kind of thing to have to use potions and poisons before a battle lilmanmf yeah fair enough combat is a little bland my bad highlights yeah 2019 was a horrible year for gamers and it s made me lose faith in the industry to the point i m cautious about buying any games whereas before i would buy a game as soon as it came out because i knew it would be good no cyberpunk worthless list it bothers me that people call every open world game gta like it s so fkn annoying it s because people are stupid and open world isn t a descriptive enough also i have the carona virus your mom is gta like darkbehindflat u gud bru sad but respect to rockstar to define the open world genre buttcheeks only if it s about shooting in a modern like world which issa lotta games gta is so good that it sets the standard duck sauce haha good one gta is decent but other open world games have done it better also souls like game seriously buttcheeks hello funny thumpnail also hear a shit ton of people say witcher like or skyrim like what s ur point buttcheeks he s 12 let him be duck sauce not really just most describe the open world type games as gta like their not wrong but could use few others then gta damn no new tenchu yet i ll get cyberpunk meanwhile man this list is extremely lazy its basically the same list as the pc and xbox version with a few add ins ghostwire cyberpunk 2077 ghosts of sushima and elden ring get announced my wallet chuckles i am in danger ps4lyfe a lot of these games made me just say meh few jems i think but the way publishers release games now most of these titles you ll probably have to wait for fixes or content after release but i could be wrong i want to be wrong will be trying a lot of these games anyway i m really excited for a lot of these i really want to be interested in watch dogs 3 but i don t know about that scale ac odd was just so fucking big and i wanted to see it all the map for watch dogs is just london so it s not massively big like other ubisoft maps if you made this list for xbox it would be top 5 games coming to the xbox in 2020 ok i am adding to my birthday list ouch that wasn t me it was my wallet why title this video as top 30 plays games if just about every game is available on every other console this is the same exact list minus 3 games from the xbox video forgot to mention persona 5 being censored in the west what s the background music which starts at 10 50 beyond good and evil is so old that i ve played it a few times and it s still be long enough that i don t remember any of it out of all ghost of tsushima is my most anticipated i waited till 2020 for my hawk face reveal this might be a controversial opinion but i think dreams is the most revolutionary game of all time a future classic we already know what s number 1 thankful it is falcon best parts are from 0 00 to 17 09 what if doom win game of the year can t wait for ghost of tsushima just so sucker punch can get to making another infamous lmao how come you guys never list your background music used for your vids would really like to know jr monty helll and idk i want madden nfl 21 but not made by ea lol 2 56 what happen to the word confused lol why does it sound like ehroar is running strikes with a sick weapon isn t there a samurai jack game coming out i was waiting for this list i think i need a loan final fantasy vii remake is going to be the best game this year wild sounds like far cry primal uuuuh not trying to be rude but you forgot dying light 2 that s gonna be a banger of a video game it s been delayed indefinitely unfortunately skull and bones is mostly likely 2021 are they ever going to release new infos on cyberpunk i cant wait isn t there already enough relax be patient after a huge crisis in game industry with games being released all crashy and unplayable lootboxes taking over and a massive flood of remasters you still manage to have any hope and create hype npikdnink gmininsk houkai its from the makers of the witcher 3 that game is stil perfect npikdnink gmininsk houkai yes npikdnink gmininsk houkai bruh the game is in development since 2012 i don t they will try to include loot boxes after so much effort plus cd project red has a good reputation for the games that they release i m hyped miera1029 i thought witcher 3 was garbage albert moffet can i ask you why just waiting for re8 2020 the year of game delays i m just waiting for battlefield 6 feminists vs patriarchy nazis i hope the next battlefield will be good as long as we play the patriarchy we shall be ok lol warning i am not an ironman fan so idk but does he shoot lazers from his hands project sakura xbox people always talking about teraflops ssd resolution fps lmao xbox where are your games at ps4 out sold xbox one by 70 million consoles and ps5 console will have similar specs that the new xbox has with way more exclusive games and xbox fans actually think they in competition with playstation i loved how playstation dropped out of e3 and all the other events so they can host their own events so excited for nioh 2 i already played and completed ff7 remake when i was 12 had to use that imagination to really understand what an amazing experience that masterpiece is can t wait the rule of two so you were 12 in 2020 behroz taib that s what i m saying behroz taib he s saying he remade the game the best he could in his mind and played it warrxnt behroz taib r woosh pesticide sheriff thats what he s saying read it the rule of two hr the rule of two hello outriders kinda gives me a third person souls like shooter disintegration looks like nothing else it looks like spicy destiny i played the beta its kinda shit uncle crispy i heard the gameplay itself is fun but what they do with the game is shit its another moba thats it the gameplay couldn t be further from destiny benis combat showed in the brief clip looked like generic pve enemies i was literally just going by the clip where you know the game looks like spicy destiny played the beta and its the worst game ever does anybody get excited playing doom2 mods and overhauls it s midgar pronounced midgarrrrr say it like a pirate lol after hearing everyone butcher mako i can t

beyond good and evil 2 will not come out this year soccer wars a lot of these arent ps exclusive probably should ve just done a top 10 this game really makes you feel like the last of us ign meanwhile

remakes for adults that can t seem to let go of their childhood why not put that energy into creating new games and stories instead of making old ok games just look better and i for one am not looking

to my hands on ghost of tsushima thanks guys this is fantastic list you guys should and need to make the texts in the corner larger and more visible but its a e s t h e t i c i fucking want the predator hunting grounds and ghost of tsushima i hope beyond good and evil 2 comes out this year oh female predator first person only in cyber punk is a huge mistake i will never buy an open world first person game like why boring these games look boring they don t make games like they used to delayed till september well i m not looking forward to the last of us 2 i hated the last of us it was honestly a chore to get through wish uncharted 6 would have been in this list i cant wait for dying light 2 dreams sounds like a new roblox to me this list has to be a must see kerbal space program 2 is not getting enough hype 0 32 why is he acting like the dislike button doesn t exist great now i just need a ps4 d at this point you might as well wait it out with ps5 coming this year and yes it will be able to play ps4 games buying a ps4 or even a ps4 pro is a waste sinnerdizzle any console is a waste of money lmao just play on pc brah smokeyjoe bruh you say this on a video about ps4 games after you say you need one what point are you making all i care about is last of us 2 everything else is background noise last of us 2 lesbian edition who lesbian we really need a shinobi from ps2 remastered that game so hard you know anyone else wondering if there s ever gonna be an xcom 3 enemy unknown and xcom 2 were both great and some of my favorite games and i m hoping there will be a third one coming eventually still salty cyberpunk got pushed back whyyy my body was ready chrollo lucifer no one remembers a bad game that shipped on time no one remembers how late a good game was michael pohoreski 100 ps4 sucks no more delays please honestly i don t want lad of us 2 because i m not a fan of lesbian drama and the game looks to be mainly a lesbian lover story with the infection taking a back drop once i found out no joel i literally lost all will to play this game sorry but lesbian love drama ain t my style i m waiting for ghost of tsushima it and kh3 were why i bought a ps4 what about biomutant his voice is kinda syncronized with the video at 4 56 tlou 2 video gaimes the last of us 2 is coming out a day before my birthday so mother i am in need of your financial support i understood that reference good luck playing as a trap lol devon same lol tlou2 is for 18 that s a good game good luck svissmail dotnet what are you saying lol hey that s my name for me its coming 4 days after my bday it s coming out on my birthday and couldn t have been any more perfect for the sequel of the best game of all time 0 i m hoping vr ditches the light based tracking dude it s hit and miss what about skyrim redfall when is that coming out 2026 why does this predator have boobs can t wait for elden ring give us bloodborne 2 demon souls remaster ps5 elden ring and ghosts of tsushima but i really hope elden ring doesn t launch until 2021 on the ps5 re3 should be pretty sweet too is gameranx filled with weebs or somethin damn lol there are so many great games coming out this year i m not sure when i ll have time to do anything else it s especially great for horror my list as it stands so far in no particular order is tlou2 re2 r remothered broken porcelain dark pictures anthology little hope little nightmares 2 dying light 2 i can only hope cyberpunk 77 ghost of tsushima nioh 2 it ll probably be too much to hope for visage full release but hey i can dream cyberpunk should be 1 ghost of tsushima little nightmares 2 dark pictures and so many indies its re3 r how can you buy all this game i can buy just 2 per year but it s not for money problem it s because my parents don t let me get too games even if i paid it with my money persona 5 royale because i didn t play the original the last of us 2 cyberpunk2077 my first option final fantasy vii remake and indies that i could get for free in my pc but i m only can choose 2 of this ada alonso how old are you lol tou vang probably like 13 or something ada alonso lmao i ve already bought like 5 games this year ada alonso i think most people here don t have to worry about their parents dictating how many games they can have lol for me i can t buy too many games because i lack the time what with balancing a full time job and college oh m lady you do not know what a good game is if you would only grow a neckbeard you will develop a personal antenna for good games now i think i speak for everyone allow me to take you on a date where i can have some sensual time with you lol raspiroope hahaha i am 16 bro i am studiying bachiller in spain is to prepare to university and yes it s not too strict like i told it i could buy more than 2 games but normally a video game is like a reword for me so a reword is not 20 per years if i am studying my reward is for my good marks and is spain there are 3 periods each curse so more or less 3 per year no more cyberpunk and last of us2 is gonna break records underrated last of us is garbage and only appeals to uneducated kids tho hollow skull hollow skull are you crazy an ff remake over cyberpunk lol are you sure it s not a trusty falcon even though it has no definitive release date ghostwire tokyo is one i remember getting quite the buzz unfortunately with ikumi nakamura s departure it is hard to say what is going to come of it i m not sure if it will be out this year for sure beyond good and evil 2 won t be and that was on the list i don t think her leaving is gonna have much effect on the games overall quality mijack if she was just doing regular design sure but she was the creative director the only way i don t see it having much effect is if they were in the last stages of production which i am not too sure they are gorilla mac it s unfortunate but shinji mikami is still there and he s done some great work it s too early to say what the game will be like since we only saw a teaser trailer but i m optimistic alot of people are saying it s cancelled god i hope not it looks awesome july 7 2020 is the release date look at the original trailer at 0 20 the red poster in the back yeah ya boy be farting out here in these streets gorilla mac hello skull n bones the secret society that us presidents are apart of resident evil 3 should on this list nemesis is the best horror game bad guy ever ff7 remake and cyberpunk does any one know if predator hunting grounds is online only or is there a single player component to the game as well i am missing the rainbow six quarantine tops at least half of the resr if the games now r6s has almost 30 mil active players features will always beat exclusives imo not that sony has xbox beat we obviously don t know yet but play anywhere alone makes xbox better regardless until sony drops similar features l if god of war 2 came out this year it definitely would of been tied for game of the year with tlou 2 predator look way better than the first trailer i would give whatever it takes just to play cyberpunk 2077 early stop comparing cyberpunk to gta notice unlike the xbox videos most of these games can only be played on ps4 lol sony microsoft period developers having to make sure that the non existant female player base has the option to play as a female protagonist is starting to actually hurt games soooo what is final fantasy persona 5 remake resident evil 3 and of course ffvii remamke man i remember why my ps4 collects dust now boo get off the stage tf ur so boring i think even though i dont know much about it ghost of tsushima is the number 1 on my most anticipated game i m intrigued for sure i want to check that one out when it comes out ps5 still a myth microsoft is king rip to all of our wallets my playstation fam i m an industrial commercial electrician my wallet is just fine i m a poor college student i ve become super picky rip wallet thank you brother yours is no match to mine getting sucked the moment it comes out rip my wallet gonna like that for more than 3 years riperoni and cheese theres 95 multiplats fam i m lucky but i am very picky about what games to get i m too picky now but agreed this year be lookin crazy yes indeed my playstation pirate buccaneer crusader friend yes verily nah my wallet will be fine aside from sony owning a vast majority of it lol get a better job zach miller you mean our parents money install a new hard disk 5tb just because every game is 100gb wehatefleur no wehatefleur just because you still live with your parents doesn t mean the rest of us do p well yea y all gotta pay for online to prey psn don t go down cyberpunk 2077 i m not getting it why because i don t like the first person perspective of it i m sorry but no after i heard that you can customize what your character looks like but was first person only i lost all interest idk if that s changed and i really do not care you got me fucked up if you tell me you can customize your character but it s first person like that s really counter intuitive got my collectors edition re3 and that might be my last ps game this gen if ps5 is backwards compatible with ps4 ill keep buying a few games but im ready for next gen i might be in the minority but the predator game seems fukin amazing and could be great if they do it right right hopefully they dont make a wrong turn then we ll end up with another friday the 13th game ps4 master race cry more xboners enjoy sea of thevies 2 and halo 78584 is anyone more excited for ghost of tsushima than the last of us p2 always on time for a gameranx vid the last of us part 2 is easily the best game on this list second i would say ffvii remake then ghosts of tsushima lolololololol sure buddy you keep telling yourself that naughty dogs games are dull dramas in comparison to any game on this list also re2 remake is better than both current gen nd games combined lets not even talk about elden ring rofl ahhh naughty dog fans i know that s your opinion but if the resident evil 3 remake is as good as the re2 remake then that s some serious competition doom eternal is shaping up quiet nicely with the master levels slayer gates and everything that heard seen about it plus the long awaited cyberpunk 2077 to should be a great year for gamers eternally hers re3 remake will no doubt be good but it s lacking what the original re3 had the event choices mercenaries etc so i cannot put that as one of the greatest games this generation it is nowhere on the level of tlou2 and ffvii remake you are clearly hurt by my opinion that s why you responded ah silver delusional absolutemma101 i m not hurt at all you stated your opinion and i m allowed to state mine all i was saying essentially was not to judge things too quickly these games haven t even been released yet take care man eternally hers i m not at all interested in cyberpunk i ll probably pirate beat it once then uninstall what else overhyped pile of trash you guys think is on par with ffvii remake ghosts of tsushima and tlou2 absolutemma101 you re totally contradicting yourself if you aren t interested at all you wouldn t torrent and play cp 2077 another potentially amazing game to add to the list would be hellblade 2 senua s saga eternally hers i didn t like re7 at all yet i pirated that shit played it and uninstalled it cyberjunk 2077 will be no different play it once uninstall it then talk a lot of shit about the game just like i m doing now eternally hers i ll pirate that on pc too that game won t touch the last of us part 2 eternally hers cyberjunk 2077 is overrated if i was never interested in any of the witcher games cyberjunk 2077 will be no different it s an overhyped pile of trash that a lot of so called gamers are hyping because it s not exclusive absolutemma101 a person who has no interest in something wouldn t go out of their way to do it is the thing believe it or not you seem interested in the games so that you can shit talk about them that s a rather sad life if you waste time on something just so that you can shit talk about it must have super low self esteem and your self worth depends on he last of us two developers don t make games for people like you anyways they make them for the fans who actually enjoy the games they play peace out man i don t want tlou2 no sport game should ever be on a list like this wtf why does predator have boobs is what i like 2 know i m not sure about the last of us 2 the first one didn t do it for me not big on zombie stuff resident evil 2 was good though i can t wait for the last of us part ii and ghost of tsushima remakes remakes where s the meat my guy there were only like 2 remakes there weren t many did u call the ffvii story silly hmmmm is it just me or does falcon sounds a bit sad on this video damn so many games coming out lol choppa you already know that eagle finna die i m not a tlou guy but i ll need 1 or 2 extra controls to play 5000 hours of final fantasy 7 remake and cyberpunk 2077 i was waiting for dl 2 i m gunna b very busy clearly lol looking forward to the elder scrolls greymoor greymoor x legion x adds skyrim to eso disturbed socks skyrim was already in eso greymoor expands on it kevin speir trash hollow skull so grateful we had your elaborate take on the matter too many games i m not even sure a lot of these games are going to come out this year i really hope they do but some games we ve barley heard shit about hi keith me too but do you feel a bit like i do and that s they are going to come out after ps5 so these games can up their graphical impression many don t need the ps5 but i do feel we re getting alot of unknowns this year the problem is this year e3 that is gonna be cancelled because the corona outbreak exactly it s only february we ve got plenty of time there is plenty of time but we ll see after e3 if it happens i have no problem waiting for some of these games though if it makes the games better yeah true lol if you don t hear shit about it it s not releasing this year tou vang i feel like a third of this list was like it miggght come out this year ain t nooo way elden ring or beyond good and evil 2 are coming out this year lol cader locke right those two are definitely not coming out i think we saw 30 seconds of elden ring that was that wasn t even gameplay beyond good and evil has been quiet for like 3 years do u work for the company no have you called and asked the company no oh ok stfu keith hello alex dias the actual event may be but the info will still be released like how sony did last year elden ring and yakuza 7 are pretty much my most anticipated at the moment from what i have heard about yakuza 7 the gameplay is pretty good as for the story from what i have heard its a tear jerker uncle crispy the yakuza series always has great storytelling judgment last year knocked it out of the park as well uncle crispy i finished the game on youtube and hell the story it is generic and like 80s chinese japanese drama but it is well executed uncle crispy well yakuza always had better stories then most of the western games so i m not worried that much id be worried with no kiryu in yakuza 7 feels bad man lee sasuki ok and cyberpunk 2077 reed hello need elden ring my most anticipated is tales of arise i think i will be better then nearly everything on this list actually no when i beat the last of us i thought it was a complete story i did not expect a sequel at all and didn t think it needed one but since it sold so well here we are i m probably not going to get it at least not this year agreed on my initial play through i absolutely loved the ambiguity of the ending even after several more play throughs i still feel like the games ending is amazing but in naughty dog i trust especially after uncharted 4 the way nd weave storytelling and character development along with gameplay is just incredible i preordered my copy a good 2 years ago i recon so i m obviously gonna be stuck in from the jump cyberpunk 2077 pre order nioh 2 waiting for elden ring ghost of tsushima and tlou2 xd where is rust you always miss on persona 5 scramble what about rust npc s be like brexit bad top my ass more like all triple a s if i see persona 5 one more time i m actually looking forward to minecraft dungeons for some reason no one else in the world says yakuza or iteration like that good list though also skall he said skull correctly the second time unfortunately falcon doesn t care how ignorant he sounds nearly every video has complaints about him don t forget midgar 15 13 or so the way he says it just feels off doom eternal cyberpunk 2077 and last of us 2 are my most anticipated definitely bannerlord is the only thing im looking forward to this year everything else is wait and see how they fuck it up mine is definitely dying light 2 jean sandler same blackbeardyman mine are cyberpunk ghosts of tsushima ff7 re3 and last of us 2 dabandfap oh ghost of tsushima of course why are you excited for cyberpunk i kind of want to like it but i can t get hyped about it don kapsalon i wouldn t say i m hyped for it it s just one of the games i m most excited to see how it will do if other games i wasn t paying much attention to do great then i m all for it too don kapsalon yup me neither overly futuristic games just aren t my style and the gameplay looks just like a generic fps the story might be good though but in an open world i expect more than just a good story blackbeardyman oh ok but you could say that about almost every game tho if no 1 isnt ff7 remake i m unsubscribing i think that the predator game should rank higher unless of course the rank does not indicate anything in particular it s a really interesting concept yea but it s been done before the concept i mean all i want is dying light 2 chiggr i m going to drag that game out for weeks when it finally releases i ll never want it to end laurel reef ahhhhh my people i was late to the dying light bandwagon as im scared of horror games or at least i thought i was haha the dying light has made me love them i explored every nook and cranny of the world i loved the music the atmosphere the parkour the fact i could make weapons and with my speed feel unstoppable but then terrified at night i dragged the game out so long and was so happy that there was dlc and a whole new map i sing this games praises all the time i spoke to my brother about it and he said yeah i tried it but got bored and stopped playing i was so disgusted in him but then again he only plays 1 game all year round sooo sorry to chat loads about the dying light i just consider it my favourite game of all time alongside horizon zero dawn and it just changed my world for a while whilst playing it and im so thankful and can not wait for the new one i hope they only added improvements to the game as nothing massive needed changing just small improvements would be amazing imo il shut up now amazing 2020 the broke year actually true since the cov 19 approached you don t wanna go to work but there are tons of game you wanna buy broke deeply vicky tric hello no but yes beyond good and evil 2 won t be out till after march of next year ubi pretty much confirmed it resident evil 3 is my most anticipated game i pre ordered literally right after the reveal trailer lol this is a great year from the point of a gamer were is rust ahum call of duty 2020 maybe donkey kong approves cyberpunk 77 final f 7 raffa moreira sometime this year yea i bet half of these games don t come out this year i want horizon zero dawn 2 patience let em improve on what they got gotta wait for ps5 that game was shit ezequiel di stefano trash game its took 7 years for them to build that game just do the calculation such a boring game though yeah man it ll probably be a launch title for ps5 at least i hope so played horizon zero dawn for a couple days and regretted buying it at all jeremy r if you love action rpg you would like it i m not even a fan of such types of games but still managed to enjoy the game but i can get where you re saying that from let s hope not yeah hzd is better than the witcher 3 lekzie69 heresy like that will get you burned at the stake jordan spencer meh witcher 3 combat is garbage hzd was a snore fest most unimpressive and forgettable characters throughout the game low quality animation dante s inferno don t you mean forgettable if you say unforgettable you re praising the game damn didnt know there were so many horizon haters its a gorgeous game where you make your own fun sorry yall dont enjoy that goddamn jeremy r nah you just have shit taste hzf is a masterpiece robert keane nope is a masterpiece and fun game all the dickheads commenting that zero dawn wasn t a good game would you even know a good game if it slapped you on the face can t wait for zero dawn 2 because the first game was amazing it wasn t bad but it certainly was not great imo it s a boring ass game great gameplay but the bland open world and story just doesn t give me the drive to finish i like the world of horizon zero dawn but the problems are the characters they re so bland and forgettable especially the main character the quests are also repetitive and boring the idea setting was amazing but everything else was such a disappointment story was garbage and so was the combat ai was one of the worst i ve come across on current gen me too u never know it might come out on ps4 dante s inferno low quality animation horizon zd won the award for best animations of the year at developer s conference 2017 lmao cutter elf wasn t a good year for video games anyway a mini console game botw won goty of 2017 lmao the other nominees were shitty games like pubg and destiny 2 yo i was about to watch then i realized that i only play xbox cone boi but you decided to watch because you commented on this video anonymous you have a valid point but i stopped the video when i realized that i had an xbox now if you excuse me i m going to buy a ps4 get you an ps bro won t be disappointed i m sorry but i don t want to play tlou 2 dying light 2 i love gameranx because it reminds me of the days when i was a kid and would come home and watch g4 networks show x play a show and channel i hold dear in my heart all of your content gives me a small feeling of nostalgia and some what takes me back to that time thank you gameranx where s 2k doom comes out march 20th or so dud this list made me realize that my wallet is in big danger like milk duds my wallet is going to be pleading for help from all the new games monty kashyap i m sorry little one jimoaijustsunkyourship what what wallet im gonna need to sell mine to be able to get these good games a significant part of these games will most likely not be released in 2020 hehe i m in trouble facts inappropriately name i laughed so hard at this fr dude my hard drive had a seizure just hearing this facts jimoaijustsunkyourship underrated comment nice monty kashyap hello it shouldn t be because quite literally all these games are almost ass lil vato aka yato that s not true monty kashyapthe pathless marvel nioh 2 and ghost of tsushima are the only interesting looking games every thing else is pure trash same generic shit weve gotten last decade lil vato aka yato literally those games are almost ass how it that even physically possible maybe if you went with metaphorically your opinion could be credible albeit a very unpopular opinion cee moe that s a funny way of spelling fact lil vato aka yato lol well played my credit card is maxed inappropriately name lmao its the highway to the daynja zone not mine barely anything looked interesting to me right now im playing crysis 2 for ps3 that game predicted the corona virus and alien invasion i m sure nobody else feels the same but i m looking forward to the new fairy tail game brett miller i was waiting for them to mention that game do people still care about fairy tail lol the game looks like a pretty good jrpg and it s fairy tail so whats not too like it s unfortunate that not many people seem to be talking about it brett miller it s fairy tail that s exactly the big problem svissmail dotnet fairytail is something you either love or hate i personally really like it but i do see the flaws it has compared to most of the defensive blind fanboys girls it has too much fanservice and asspull powerups but if you like what fairytail was at its core its kinda easy to see past those and enjoy it for what it is thomas hoogeveen i disagree fanservice is not a problem the real problem is the poor written story and the events that doesn t make sense svissmail dotnet too much fanservice is most definetly a problem thomas hoogeveen it could be a problem i guess if it becomes like a hentai thomas hoogeveen i agree i love it too but i also acknowledge that there are some major flaws in the series like the fact there are literally no stakes when it comes the characters living or dying because they always live but i m willing to overlook that and enjoy it for what it is thomas hoogeveen i believe that fan service is only a problem when it impacts the story in a major way i can t recall any of that in fairy tail but i do remember seeing a lot of fanservice and them being extremely self aware about it i m not a big fan of it either but i m willing to overlook it if it doesn t intrude in the story too much brett miller i m able to overlook it as well since i do love what fairytail is at its core but sometimes the fanservice does frustrate me especially the stupid amount of fanservice to lucy it kinda made me dislike her character overall wow i thought everyone forgot about wild glad it s actually coming out i ve been actively searching for updates on it since i ve heard about it years ago now i feel slightly better that someone with some repore mentioned it imagine having a playstation and missing out on the legendary xbox this was brought to you by the xbox gang hell ya i hope everyone has a kick ass time playing all these awesome games in 2020 thanks you too bro definitely likwise i think there is very good games ghost of tsushima is my most anticipated game of this next year for sure when i was watching game awards i was so happy to see ps4 game when they show it i was really afraid it being a ps5 exclusive game kakarot 20 gameranx strikes again how many of the top 19 won t be released this year 12 15 remember these are the guys that didnt have maximum carnage in top 10 comic inspired games of all time lmfao get to the choppa 32 views but 101 like really youtube man cyber punk is gonna have me wanting to quit my job and leave my gf lmao you do that any way just don t ever neglect your pet if you have one anthem 2 0 micheal93k cdpr haven t released a bad game to date i don t think they re going to fuck up their shot to get into the mainstream logan l doesn t seem that interesting to me people are just hyped because there s keanu reeves in it like that s gonna make it any better i m way more excited for the last of us 2 ghost of tsushima resident evil 3 final fantasy 7 etc logan l we get it you have a girlfriend i m so fortunate to have a gamer girlfriend we always play together ll nn i want a tenchu game joel00111 i also want a new tenchu ll nn people were hyped way before keanu was even mentioned to be in the game hope the game fails miserably e o keanu is a monotonous dummy general maddox lol why are you so mad we get it you dont have one oswald daryl felix no you dont ll nn id say people are hyped because of the developers previous record for quality and respecting their fan base not so much the one being in it lol already done he says how could u not know what lego star wars is but continues to explain what it is that s logic tifa is so hot i m still a bit sad they delayed dying light 2 but i 100 trust the developers to deliver since they ve supported the first game for now up to 5 years i am 100 sure the last of us 2 is going to be fantastic lets hope 1st one was mediocore in everything but story george r r martin should concentrate on finishing his f king books sakura wars artist is the mangaka of bleach pre ordered doom eternal resident evil 3 and last of us 2 today cant wait oooou you got money astro thyovrlrd 180 dollars isn t very much i ve been waiting for wild for so long i want cyberpunk and re 3 remake funny how resident evil is suck a trash series with the worst voice acting and character acting of anything ever shit mechanics nonsense storyline and dialogue and ethos cheap nostalgia and bad camera angels and controls but yeah why not be excited lynchinjesus well tell me another good horror game that makes me jumpscare besides from outlast ill wait deadblue evil within 2 deadblue alan wake evil within 2 alien isolation last of us and dying light games with actual good game play storyline and voice acting lynchinjesus the evil within wasn t my favorite horror game last of us was really good but i didnt really like alien lynchinjesus what did resident evil do to you that you hate so much deadblue its just lazy game making if you have the ability to make games well why not do it right why skip out on a storyline or follow any logic at all hire flat unrealistic writers and voice actors make clunky game play do better they have the abilty but seem to choose to make nonsense its frusterating lynchinjesus but they do be having good jumpscares tho lynchinjesus have you played untill dawn i think thats my favorite horror game deadblue jump scares are the cheapest tactics for horror more games could just simply add them lynchinjesus what do you like in horror games then welp i ll have to wait until the ps5 comes out to play these games my ps4 pro crapped out about 2 hours ago for the third time this video arrived just in time to rub some salt in the wound downloaded dreams yesterday and didn t even get chance to try it dammit lol not going to bother getting it fixed or buying another with the new consoles coming out in 8 9 months guess i ll tackle my xbox backlog in the meantime oh well the games i m most interested in are remakes lol this list is great definitely can t wait to get my hands on ghost of taushima cyberpunk 2077 last of us 2 so amazing wish i got the ps4 instead of my lame xbox there s always next year can t wait to join the good side get a pc its better than both bestintheworld but idk what price to go for 3 words ghost of tsushima ghost of tsushima ghost of tsushima ghost of tsushima favourite kurosawa film yojimbo james okay good i m not the only one super stoked for that game captain tusk50 well i m so excited i ll be like playing a kurosawa film men they have a lot of exclusives this year like 13 of the 30 are exclusives tlou is a 10 10 quality game i wish i could like it but the gameplay is not so good for me just repeting same thing hope tlou2 to be way better wait where is mount blade 2 bannerlord what time is the thumbnail game at click bait amazing list predator hunting grounds looks so cool badass and awesome oh yeah baby definitely wild been waiting for info and tsushima dreams has potential to be the only game you ll ever need most other stuff is cross platform ps4 or pc or xbox nobody cares kakarot wasnt that good woooooo sup falcon i have an xbox and i i really predator game could come to xbox i remember when the yakuza like a dragon demo premiered on april fool s day 2018 and everybody was surprisingly open to it the joke was on all of us because sega had plans to release a turn based yakuza game all along recite the whole we are number one song right now with sound effects 10 minutes ago 2 views 39 likes doom eternal is in all 30 places in my list for obvious reasons cool looking games can t wait don t lie who s not in full screen i m gifting to everyone who subs to me don t lie who s not in full screen i m gifting to everyone who subs to me whats an xbox theyre screwed next console war too never have we seen such a console far so far from its perch hole in dans sock i genuinely earn enough in an hour at work to buy 2 brand new ps5 s and i wouldn t have one given to me for free awful network awful joypads and the most toxic gaming community like you no thanks might buy one just to smash it up it s not as if i d miss the money gamepass is cool tho iwtmltyb yep xbox has absolutely no toxic gaming community whatsoever just the highest number of hackers out there next to pc and you make a 1000 an hour huh thank you once again for showing us just how empty a millionaire s life and personality is the way he pronounces yakuza is infuriating that thumbnail lookin better than real life not bad for the upcoming world s 2nd best console all the chavs will probably love it microsoft fony i have a gut feeling that the last of us 2 is going to be a phenomenal game that ll easily crack the nominations for game of the year i m really looking forward to it and many people are too i totally agree cyberpunk will win goty at a canter iwtmltyb the last of us has more hype it will pretty easily get goty jack hyland cyber punk 2077 has way more hype tlou 2 looks like an overhype tbh 7 years to make a game that should ve taken 3 4 iwtmltyb agree but the fanboys dont wanna hear that doctor d0m3 bro they started after uncharted 4 doctor d0m3 how would you know how long a game takes to make game development is extremely complex the argument in this thread is so dumb lol goty is meaningless its pretty much a popularity contest its like saying rihanna won musician of the year over freakin beethoven or similar type of nonsense frankly i couldnt care less about naughty dogs games as i find them as dull as a broken brick the only goty i would call a masterpiece in the last decade is sekiro there were far better games that released in the same year regarding the rest of the goty line up ah silver thank you someone said it it s him i finally found him just some guy without a mustache highly doubt it people need to stop sucking naughty dogs micropenis because they re not that special with there mediocre gameplay and uninteresting story it s either cyberpunk the last of us 2 or ff7 remake can t see anything elsr coming close just some guy without a

dumb comment it took like 10 seconds and i m sorry i hurt your feelings over a shitty console i m looking forward to nioh 2 and cyberpunk choppa biggest dub and l all in one wow video title should be changed to top 30 masterpieces of 2020 tlou part 2 is my number one anticipated game just finished replaying tlou remastered on survivor difficulty such an amazing game bilbo baggins nah bro gotta do that grounded difficulty mode never figured out the love for the game just not my style adam hearts the story man the story gameplays alright but the story is beautiful has some of the most emotional and best scenes of all gaming try it out trust me story atmosphere attention to detail and overall delivery was excellent the gameplay was it s weakest point and it barely mattered because it worked without flaw rico aguilar i hear you i made it about half way on grounded but then lowered the difficulty to survivor i respect those that can do it all the way on grounded cletus zimmerman nah the gameplay and the story are amazing dbz that s your opinion man and that s awesome early pretty late for new games since past will be out soon me sees ps4 sighs and looks up in disgust what do u mean
