 watchdogs was a good game now the second on oof not sure how gta5 didnt get even an honorable mention the campaign sucked it was disorienting short and contained so many loose ends it frayed by the time i was a billionaire i mean at least theres an awesome engine to mod the older gtas on right day 32 of asking for top nyc games watch dogs was amazing andromeda had such good gameplay imo and the story missions were pretty fun at times last couple story missions were exciting too but man they dropped the ball on the exploration part modern warfare no mans sky warcraft 3 reforged came out a month 2 late i loved watch dogs it was an amazing game imo fable 3 was so dumbed down and easy why is watch dogs on this list andromeda is the disappointment on this list that i got early enough to feel surprisingly disappointed i love fallout 76 but the only reason i don t like anthem is because how short the story is watch dogs was my shit dont care what nobody say andromeda is not that bad it s s not great either but it s better then most of the others games on this list nope haven t played a single mass effect game and i still know that one s trash wooooo for a second there thought you meant game of thrones from telltale games let me relax so i no one going to talk about the 1st division game take a look at that e3 reveal trailer and compare it to the actual game at launch this is coming for a fan of that game lol anthem was the biggest troll to gamers in watch dogs the graphics and shaders were still used in the alone digital trip but you cant enjoy them because if you take one wrong step it will instantly be turned into night time and there will be a bunch of robots with security cameras for heads chasing you mass effect andromeda was a good game i don t see why people ripe on it so much i mean they did fix a lot of the shit that was screwd up i love watch dogs one but i really wished they added more juicy graphics and concept but the story was great assassin s creed origins and oddysey i really liked duke nukem forever uhmmm borderlands 3 wd1 was good what s wrong with it where s no mans sky there should have been for honor on the list i like anthem and mighty number 9 it s funny when fallout 76 came up and i looked at my phone s battery percentage and it is at 76 far cry 5 was pretty fuckin boring why is borderlands 3 not here terrible story that literally butchered the legacy of the past games top 2 disappointment single player games forced to become multiplayer why these companies don t understand that not everything can be online the memes are so on point in every video of yours lmao y all got a new subscriber fable 3 is fun if played straight but as an rpg it is pretty boring you couldn t dual wield in halo 1 mass effect andromeda is a good game i feel like a lot of the shit it gets is from people who haven t played it or at least not longer than a week most of the graphical issues were fixed in a month or so after release and the story was genuinely good i dunno i know it wasn t as good as any of the original three but i loved it i loved watchdogs but it was so overhyped sending bail money happy i pray cyberpunk 2077 doesn t end up on a list like this in the future forgot about ghost recon breakpoint just cause 4 not a bad game but the graphics oh the graphics my sweat water physics what have they done to you the great colors of jc3 gone mass effect 3 s ending was fine don t at me also the people went to colonize a different galaxy before the reapers showed up silly still a stupid idea but mass effect 3 have more than one ending black ops 4 where in the world is no man s sky i don t think andromeda should be no 1 the story wasn t that bad the writting wasn t horrible the gameplay was okay yes there were a lot of bugs the facial animations suck and ruin the immersion and some of the voice acting was bad but other than that everythig else was okay and i enjoyed the game more or less altho i guess if you compare it to mass effect 2 the best one it s really bad no mans sky calling it as 1 haven t watched the video yet gonna do it rn i understand fallout 76 then but now it s not so bad especially with the npc update around the corner i love watch dog so much the division 1 was hypep a watchdog looking demo and it got watchdogged biggie like crazy and riddled with hacker but then again i must say i ended up loving that games spent 3000 hours playing it fallout 76 deserves the 1 spot i think watch dogs 1 was really good and the drug trips like the robo spider and the hell car and the psychedelic bounce were really good i loved duke nuke em forever it was a silly ass childish game that didn t take itself seriously like the other billion shooters at the time it reminded me of just being in an arcade having fun a throwback to a more fun time ff13 ff14 max payne 3 the list goes on bioware i used to love you i want to still love you please don t screw up the next dragon age hey falcon you are my fav so i need to know shrek or garfield i vote shrek glad doom eternal wasn t here dooms finished game looks better than the demo trailer i had the benefit of playing watch dogs without any prior knowledge so i liked it a lot no mans sky total war rome 2 you are really milking watch dogs arnt you running out of ideas eh fallout 76 is definitely number 1 over mass effect i actually really enjoyed andromeda enough to play through it three times so far to be honest though i see it the way he described fable 3 which i also really enjoyed i m pretty sure this was more than 10 years ago but jak and daxter last frontier anybody andromeda wasnt what i expected but it still was a very good game holy shit no man sky did not make the list why its the biggest disappointed game i ever play this past few year 2 16 it s not fallout 76 it s bad but it s not that bad am i the only one who actually liked watch dogs in the case of anthem and fallout 76 you had to have high hopes for the games in order to be disappointed i still had fun regardless the graphics for watch dogs what about wolfenstein youngblood i like dnf for what it is but you nailed it just you left out how it reached creepy agony levels with the women trapped in the wall i don t think the second watchdogs is better than the first one ugh the hate about mass effect andromeda is ridiculous did you actually finish the game also this is why i wait until several months after release now for them to fix bugs i m sorry but anthem and fallout 76 are way bigger disappointments than this game fallout 76 basically wasn t even playable for a while after if came out i feel like gears 5 should b on this list i mean gears 5 does not feel like a gears of war story or game hey don t forget to do this next year with cyberpunk as 1 wut abt destiny am i the only one on whole internet that liked watch dogs and really liked aiden pierce apparently almost every game i play i shoot for 100 completion at bare minimum i go for story completion but fallout 76 i tried i really did but it came to a point where i realized that i was ruining my experience with the prior games by playing it that is when i put it down and never went back you forgot star wars battlefront 2 how about 10 most disappointing top 10 lists on youtube i mean i m sick of getting a notification just to hear about the same failures in a random order how about some new old failures from the last decade and please do just say star wars battlefront and sonic whatever there s other games that s also not up to par please inform me of them also sorry for the rant but these lists are all the same no matter what channel tells me it was cool the first 3 years but now we re 6 years in don t forget division downgrade putting andromeda at 1 above anthem and 76 really not gonna lie i really like watch dogs i dont know why but i like the charakter in the first one and dont really like the charakter in the second one am i weird fuckin watch dogs was a good game couldn t expect any less from a masterpiece like that days gone i know it wasn t a huge game series but state of decay 2 was my biggest disappointment in gaming for honor i drowned in disappointment watch dogs 1 was a really good game it had lots to do and it s theme and atmosphere with chicago was spot on but of course people just couldn t let go of the graphics being downgraded and just kept complaining about them and ignoring what the game had to offer sure the downgrade was a shame but it didn t change the fact that the rest of the game was pretty fun to play i love the weak reasons gameranx lists to try and shit on watch dogs like weak dialogue except most of it is well written especially with jordi s character and complaining about ai i don t think i ve heard any onr else complain about any issue with the ai just sounds like you pulled that one out of your ass and barriers at the edge of the map wow who would have thought that open world games have barriers at the edge of the map lol this just feels like a lazy critique to shit on a game that was released in 2014 come on gamersnx you can do better turn this andromeda was not my favorite game on the citadel really hope we can see another entry in the series or hell i d love a modern update of the 1st 3 with extra scenarios dialogue added in playing 1 with andromeda s combat would be amazing watch dogs was so good i really enjoyed the game you are wrong gameranx it is not dissappointement i think you never really played watch dogs those who are telling that watch dogs is bad that means you never played it i really enjoyed the stealth mechanics of watchdogs i left a dislike because you are creating hate on watch dogs marvel v capcom infinite should have been on here somewhere no metal gear survive good borderlands 3 i can t stand it extremely buggy performance on console is terrible destroyed the entire borderlands story and i was hoping it would be a modern borderlands 2 what a let down still a fun game but no excuses for being so hyped up for being almost worse than pre sequel why isn t fortnite here i m surprised fallout76 wasn t number one some missing i would have put on this list no mans sky i know it s way better now but on release it was one of the biggest disappointments for the hype it gathered breakpoint battlefield 2 both ok gameplay nothing special but their monetisation ruined them so badly it negatively effected the gameplay massively but for me the biggest disappointment was the grandia hd remaster not a hyped game or very popular but it s my favourite game ever and a hd remaster on the switch sounded perfect however the first game had so many visual bugs and the widescreen is just them bluring the edges and the second game somehow lags and stutters when just walking around in the environment way worse experience then it was on ps1 ps2 i legit have spent more money on fallout 76 than child support no man s sky and sea of thieves honorable mention hah final fantasy 15 was a big disappointment no mans sky acu and division sort of but these games gotten better over the years i guess have to disagree with everything that happened with fallout 76 game breaking bugs complete lack of content broken systems deceptive marketing multiple merchandise debacles the most absurd monetization i have ever seen and plenty more this game should be ranked as the worst game of all time i swear to fuck if watchdogs is in this list i m i m idk i just love the game edit oh shit it is but not because of the game but that graphics which i agree with so i m ok with this i thing mafia 3 was the most desapointing game of the last decade andromeda isn t that bad now but that doesn t excuse how it launched i get that buuuuut fall out 76 waaay worse should of been number 1 on this list an open world set in chicago where i was born and it was trash my bum hole is itchy i completely disagree with the watchdogs bit the second game was worse than the first the first had some shitty downgrades and the driving sucked but the dialog isn t that bad the environments hacking shooting finishers night time was all amazing 2 was bland and disappointing lemme say before the video starts fallout 76 is 1 in this list edit ok now i just remember there is something worse see this is why people ruin shit for video games people fuckn complain about everything watch dogs was really good game if you don t like playing the game dont play at all simple as that gow 4 was a disappointment for me the story was short and there were only like 5 types of enemies and they had pallet swaps same with the giant bosses pallet swaps you had fire ice and poison that was how diverse the enemies are and then they tried to make the game like zeld or darksiders where you have to have a weapon or item to get to certain areas but with gow 4 it just felt like backtracking was added for filler if you try to 100 the game it may take awhile but if you just try to 75 80 complete it story included it s a short let down and the ending was disappointing as well but it won goty wow what a quality original list it s not like they ve made the same video with one or two different games mixed up it s really not like they ve reused content because they can be creative sorry my face is tired enough said nah ik fallout 76 was going to be utter crap from what we saw with eso ik it would probably be worse but that was far worse than i originally thought as for anthem well has anyone seen ea recently not too hard to foreshadow how anthem was going to go i have a good bullsh t detecter and ea is full of bullsh t okay if i m being honest i don t think androemda was nearly as bad as fallout 76 or anthem sure definitely not in the same ballpark as the trilogy but the story wasn t that bad and most of the graphics glitches were fixed in updates honest pacing and boring quests were it s only issues anthem and f76 literally crashed and glitched everytime i booted them up idk how you guys get your lists but theres a huge mistake mass effect should be slot like 7 8 because yes it was bad like really bad and the hype was high for alot of people but the problem is the hype was from me rookies not veterans however anthem had everybody into it the free flight and destiny feel was what tons tons tons of people wanted that game at launch was a tremendous letdown after 6 hours or so you are bored with nothing but gronding to do no man s sky hellooooo no man s sky shadow of the fookin tomb raider good lord the disappointment also watch dogs was a great game for me cause i completely ignored trailers and promotional stuff rage 2 seems like it should at least be a dishonorable mention i was pretty hyped for it when i first heard about it since i liked everything about the first game except for the clearly rushed ending it was a good first game with an interesting story and mechanics though i did get it like a year or so after it originally came out and got it for like 20 us dollars so most of the bugs were patched out etc but the second one to be fair i haven t played it yet but every time i am gonna buy it like when its on sale i see so many bad reviews for it about bugs glitches that are still in the game that can easily halt your progress even from the beginning and some mentioning the dlc and id s currency in order to buy it etc there is also plenty of people saying how the game is very repetitive so disappointing and they marketed it like it would be this really fun game i know i can t really say much about it when i haven t gotten it and played it yet but again everytime i am going to even when its on sale i see those negative reviews some recent and it just puts me off from the game i know there were a lot of people that didn t like the first game from the massive bugs that got fixed eventually to the story but i really enjoyed the first one except for the ending which i kinda felt like i was half way through the game at that point i am quite sure id software pulled a bunch of people off that game to rush to work on doom which cost it that polishing and finishing it needed it s kinda clear they did the same thing with rage 2 probably rushed to get it done or only had a few people working on it that probably wanted to work on doom eternal or took people from there half way through to work on doom eternal be interesting to hear some people that work there and what actually happened with the rage games cause it really does seem like that s what happened which is a shame battlefield v should be number 1 hey falcon its folks releasing a list about disappointments on ivy day no less did they ever do anything to fix mass effect andromeda i was a fan of the first 3 and want to play another mass effect game watch dogs has horrible gunplay and for some reason they don t let you shoot while driving if they fixed both of those it d be a good game it also upsets me that watch dogs had a serious story and bleak setting i liked that but when the game failed ubi didn t realize why the game failed so they changed the setting and theme of the game to be big silly wacky funtime and now it doesn t really stand out at all when compared to games like gta or even saints row i m happy with the disclaimer because that s how i felt about the games not the best but still good like i enjoy the crap out of watch dogs i promised myself never to get hyped by an ea game i feel like dark souls 2 should have been on here the first was amazing and the second was good but it was disappointing af they should have just made fallout 76 another story installment in the series not with all the mp bs i want to see how fallout 76 is gonna save it self because apparently there is an update that gives us a story and npcs im waiting for no man sky tho finally playing mass effect andromeda for the first time i think i m about halfway through but i don t know if i can even continue i don t care about any of these characters or what s going on and when i sit down to play i just want it to be over such a shame that the emotional impactful rollercoaster of the trilogy has been reduced to this soulless husk watch dogs a disappointment speak for yourself bro was expecting no man s sky fallout 76 was a disappointment at launch but it s gotten much much better how is destiny not on here i ll never forget that shitshow the initial cost of the game is still the clearest case of highway robbery in the gaming industry i ve ever seen my only issue with fable iii is that i have it on pc i can t play it anymore even on win 10 no man s sky it was one of the most hyped games i ve ever seen and yet didnt delivered 1 of what they promissed easy fallout 76 assassin s creed 3 and fable 3 are both on par as far as disappointing well all assassin s creed imo but especiallu the third should make a top 10 games to play during quarantine or something i m bored as hell what about atlas star wars the old republic odyssey and origins of the ac series were also a massive disappointment for the user that has played all assassins creed before these and has completed them all i can easily say origins and odyssey hold the worst assassins creed game position ever they had to go and change up literally everything and make the grinding so damn much that it feels like that s the entire game i m kinda surprised battlefront ii wasn t in this list i was expecting that to be number one it was an absolute disaster at launch that took 2 years worth of updates to recover from i have been playing battlefield since modern combat on the original xbox then bad company 1 and 2 then battlefield 3 and 4 but i m sorry battlefield 1 and 5 are trash specially coming after 4 shit even 3 is way better than 1 and 5 i wish they would come out with another modern day battlefield soon kinda tired of playing cod even if warzone is pretty good i d rather pilot the little bird helicopter and annihilate people with those miniguns or fly around in the harrier jet get ur shit together dice the last of us you forgot mafia 3 mass effect andromeda was certainly not bad enough to be number 1 game was about a 7 10 can t touch the original trilogy but it s still and enjoyable game the animations were fixed yeah it shipped bad but like a month later it was fine g e n e r a t i o n z e r o 10 most disappointing games of the last 10 years according too gameranx fallout 76 has gotten better tbh and we are getting human npcs wheres no mans sky yeah they improved the game but launch was a huge mess am i the only one that liked the original watch dogs no mans sky dogged the bullet fable 3 was my favorite game fable 2 was best game watch dogs was still fun but damn was it a disappointment in comparison to the e3 demo along with the division compare and contrast fable to dark souls lol there are many games that have followed this format but if fable 3 were dark souls 2 then mind blown thief 2014 not being on this list is a gaming sin the game tried to be the next thief game and failed so hard that it s unlikely another thief game will ever come out again not a ubisoft fan boy but i think watch dogs was good period no explanations aliens colonial marines was so bad and lied so hard that they lost a class action suit for at about 1 25 million for false advertising i am a huge fan of mass effect i ve completed all 3 andromeda doesn t count multiple times i ve been the guy the girl you know but oh my god i couldn t make it through not even five hours of that steaming pile called andromeda the worst part in my opinion is the complete and utter lack of any character development at all like i couldn t even tell you one single person in that game not one don t even remember what the main character is called and i don t care what a shame i m not sure if andromeda deserved to be number 1 i never had high expectations to begin with unlike games like watch dogs and 76 mirrors edge 2 anthem should ve been first on the account it ruin mass effect n 1 no man s sky add doom eternal to the list i loved the gameplay of anthem i still do i just need more content i need new things to shoot i need auto revives disabled at least on the harder difficulties so the boss fights are intense and that one hero that saves the team did it by saving the team and not running in circles til we could respawn literally all they had to do to fix the game was fix invisible wall problem and add lots of different gun armor customization and more than 10 missions that all function the same waiting to see if the anthem relaunch will be any better warcraft 3 reforged all i m gonna say duke nukem forever succeeded at being a duke nukem game it just so happens that a duke nukem game doesn t fit in with the current times metal gear survive no battlefront 2 i thought watch dogs mighty no 9 was good but could ve did better mafia 3 i thought watch dogs mighty no 9 was good but could ve did better i was disappointed in halo 5 s campaign i thought watch dogs mighty no 9 was good but could ve did better anthem better be on here in anthem i just fly around as a ranger for 5 minutes then get bored gears of war judgement deserves a mention especially onikiri from roblox i can t call fallout 76 a disappointment because i knew it would be a shit show right when it was announced and i m a big fallout fan i did however underestimate just what a shit show it was going to be i m used to having my hopes low for a game and then being pleasantly surprised or at the very least going well it s not as bad as i thought it would be but it s rare to know a game is going to suck and for it to not only suck but to actually get progressively worse over time and not even in the so bad it s good way like a wwe game but in a way that makes you lose faith in humanity and give up on life falcon you forgot ghost recon future solider not only did ubisoft downgrade it they literally completely changed the game itself from what they first showed metal gear survive should be number 1 where is mafia 3 watch dogs it the best game yes it got downgraded but it s better the second one no man s sky 5 27 the game have been downgraded and it s still lag on the lowest setting on my laptop lol i only have 2gb of ram at the time yes i now it s really far below the minum 6 17 what the 1st game is definitely so much better than the 2nd game the division had a disgusting downgrade watchdogs was made that way so you had to hack the game to get the real game just like the game itself get technical shenmue 3 keep being funny where s crackdown 3 i feel like destiny ought to be on this list i love the game the raids are incredible and there s really some excellent parts to it but the missed potential and continued missed potential for that franchise is insane destiny is the best i still really like it tbh i have 6k hours and i still enjoy it i stopped playing the moment it went to steam i thought it was a good moment to say goodbye and start other games fable 3 was a shocker of a game not good at all anthem was really cool if anthem 2 has way more guns way more content and bigger raids they ll succeed probably diablo 3 and destiny should be in the list d3 was so disappointing that split the fanbase and basically created competition to fill the void it created anthem was disappointing but it was kinda expected after andromeda and ea mistrust at the time destiny on the other hand people were really excited about for years it had the ridiculous 10 years plan that people were digging destiny 2 would be a better fit than anthem as well as it is a continuation of that disappointing launch talking about andromeda maybe me3 would be a better fit it clearly shook the trust people had in bioware not saying any of these games were bad some are way above average however it didn t match the insanely high expectations game of thrones didn t need to be in list quite frankly i think people expected it to be mediocre no mans sky fable 3 division destiny anthem halo 5 watchdogs def jan vendetta for ps3 nba street ps3 call of duty black ops 4 it had no campaign bad zombies to much micro dlc bad slot of recycled dlc from past games and black out horrible evolve i agree about fallout 76 and 4 was definitely better aww man i don t know dude like it could have been a better game if it was a better game i mean i mean i mean all i hear is i mean that reminds me i should finish andromeda i don t agree with number 1 mea was a very fun game yes it had issues but nowhere near the others on this list i m surprised you didn t add crack down 3 considering it was given such a bad rep last year i love andromeda why on earth was no man s sky not number 1 no mans sky it sounds like making a aaa title video game within less than a year is a completely bad idea huh no mans sky did not make it into the list thats weird thank you very much for continuing to only show relative game footage and animations and not including ur fucking face like other gaming channels thank you all opinions rightfully so here s what i think anthem i didn t even know it was a game until i had ea access i downloaded it and before playing i seen a few youtube people say it sucks ass i ignored it i enjoyed it was like warframe just not as boring better looking not as stupid and unfair i guess people who expected something out of it were mad people like me who didn t know of if until i checked it out on my own time well i enjoyed it i feel bad for people that hype video games i don t do that if i like a game before it s out i know it s a good or bad game watch dogs 1 was not that bad jeez watch dogs was actually good though always love seeing falcon wearing a suit watchdogs is a really good game i played it on 2020 and it holds up really good writing and pretty dark compared to gta saints row or any competitor i feel the the division could easily fit in this list the beta of the game made it feel like there was so much potential but the final product doesn t even stand a chance it felt dry and less enjoy full i wish they would just release the beta so no mans sky never happened everyones forgotten about no mans sky for me it was boneworks i uhhh i liked andromeda to be fair it was my first mass effect game and i got it after they d patched most of the bugs but still sorry to disagree i didnt have that many bugs in mass effect andromeda and yea i had fun with the game good story ofc not at same level as me3 but its still a good game the problem was they used old school graphics much like in me3 to stay true to the game they didnt copy paste real faces since you cant do that in an anime ish type character game i for one didnt listen to the shitstorm over the bugs for me i had like 2 3 bugs in my playthrough on pc others migth have had same and then on other platforms so people add the numbers they had in total like 1 trillion people seing 1k bugs but how many bugs could one person really expect in the game on a play through well the answer is somwhere between 1 5 and thats it minimal small insignificant bugs but you do know the shitstorm was in reality paid for by sony since they released yea guess what game anthems action was fun for me i beat the game at least fallout 76 sounds like a good choice wow i can t believe fable 3 made it onto this list that colonial marines pile of shit was developed in such a scumbag way that gearbox eventually looked scummy for it and even more scummier that they soiled another developers reputation who probably tried in the window of time they had and with the box of shit handed to them knowing that it was gonna be crap that is a bastards trick and i kind of hate bastards tricks not gonna lie i actually liked the first watch dogs i still replay it every now and then but the second one is definitely better dont be rude to me but i enjoyed fallout 76 is is no one gonna mention titan fall watch dogs is a good game in gameplay and fun aspects tho i understand and agree with all the flak me andromeda get but i really enjoyed it the problems with the game didn t stop me from really liking it and i gotta admit falcon you ve got a sexy voice man could listen to it all day not really a huge disappointment but the switch to an rpg style in gow 4 kind of sucked and i didn t like the axe as much as the blades of chaos fallout 76 has wastelanders coming with npc s and much more apparently mgsv it s one of my favorite games ever but it could ve been bar none the greatest game ever made which frankly it isn t i never beat watchdogs 1 but i was close i enjoyed it a lot watchdogs 2 i absolutely hated other than the free roaming watch dogs 3 i am very excited for watch dogs as a series has had problems but something i will give the first game is the incredible combat you can choose to do if you use focus and executions correctly high rick high reward search it up it s fun next video idea top 10 games that didn t get enough credit days gone how dare you insult my watchdogs this is a jk btw i do love wd but good video bro no man sky people are entitled to their opinion and i guess this is yours but there are worst games that should be in this list like no man s sky and many others i like watch dogs 1 it was fantastic you forgot no man sky anthem was actually fun though really andromeda topped your list halo 5 i dont care how it is now at launch it has less content than halo 1 and it is the worst campaign in the series my judgement of a game will stay the exact same at release than whatever it is now games should be released complete and not have to wait over an entire year for it to be what it should i enjoyed watch dogs maybe even more than gta 5 ha ha you serious i know it s a great game but gta v watch dogs in my opinion couldn t even scratch gta v duke nukem forever took forever to make 6 53 if it came out on ps4 and xbx1 how the hell do i have it for ps3 watchdogs is great if you have reshade on pc mass effect andromeda doesn t deserve to be number 1 here admittedly it is top three but fallout 76 is faaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr worse an honorable mention for me would be destiny so watch dogs had some meh graphics and only ok dialog and you add it to this list it was a pretty decent game all things considered you re just here to bitch about graphics which isn t the most important thing about a game no man s sky had to issue refunds when has that ever happened around april fallout 76 is gonna add npcs omg seriously why watchdogs i realize everyone shits on this game but it s good and worth it the second one to me at least just sold out to a wider audience and the first game is way better aiden peirce is 20 times better than the characters in 2 sure his character wasn t flashy and happy but that wasn t even slightly the point of his character his character was like the punisher and idc what everyone says about the game it s great i played 2 and sure it was good 2 but it was a shell of what the first was a spray painted shell like what you want but that s how i look at it also one more thing i get that the lighting and stuff was better in trailers but if that s really the biggest concern when you re playing a game then you re really confused i think and i wouldn t put a game off for bad graphics or just different looks either number one doom eternal ah gameranx soemtimes you are the ones who disappoint the most with your shit content and statements watch dogs is great and the graphics for that time were enough for sure because that was not the main thing good about the game frfr don t bring up halo if you don t know what you re talking about rdr2 is boring as fuck you should have had medal gear zombies and no mans sky fable 3 genuinely did suck it was wayyyy too short i beat in in like 4 days when i was 10 i still have not beaten fable 2 i haven t played the original much but in my opinion i think fable 2 was the best however i m very very excited to see what comes from fable 4 can t wait half of you talking is like well there s just overall meh i guess they had idea you didn t really review some of them just called them meh repeatedly in different ways like on the 76 one you said complained there were to many purchases for a expensive game but nothing else if your not actually going to give a explanatory or interesting review just shorten the video to 3 minutes instead of wasting our time i liked andromeda not as much as the trilogy but i didnt hate it hey you forgot something yandere simulator fallout 76 part crashed even by youtube app sonic forces fable 3 was a mad game angel i used to sweat that game it was so fun to play back then but it was the first one out of the three ghost recon breakpoint i wouldve switched number 1 and 2 andromeda was really bad but 76 was just on another level of bad it was unholy the last 9 2k games should be on the list any1 knows were i can download this mod 5 57 cough no mans sky cough warcraft reforged should be beyond top 1 i still love watch dogs i m even replaying it right now honestly it is amazing to me but definitely did not live up to what was portrayed for it to be i didn t like the second game very much tho woah i was not expecting andromeda to be number 1 i was expecting no man s sky lol no cod ghosts assassins creed unity or assassins creed odyssey okay the first watch wasn t that bad watch dog was better than nuke i feel like y all was grasping for sum to say i actually enjoyed duke nukem lmao i know it was crap but i got it for like 3 bucks and ended up getting almost all the achievements on 360 idk lol a guilty pleasure i guess i except cyberpunk to have the same fate watchdogs trailer looks slightly different to game everyone this is the worst thing to ever happen to gaming slightly it looks like a whole new game made on a new engine it was held back because of consoles limitations and ubicuck did not want console players to feel left out on good graphics so they just locked everything behind a wall instead i must be one of the few people who genuinely enjoyed duke nukem forever i hadn t played an fps that enjoyable since goldeneye on n64 sometimes i feel that gta5 had less features than gta4 it had bowling pool and i think it had darts i also you can go on the computer in a police car and fool around and pretend to be a cop also i feel like the car driving is kinda more realistic than gta5 after the campaign in gta4 you can do all sorts of stuff but in gta5 all it feel like you can do is just tennis and darts but that s my opinion wc3 reforged the greatest letdown of 2020 change my mind no final fantasy xv i really like remastered version of fable 1 andromeda is worse than anthem and fallout 76 i disagree didnt care for the characters yes it was the worst of the mass effects but it played fine for the most part didnt crash and had minor frame drops atleast on my ps4 cant speak for other platforms now for the graphics worse than me3 yes and no character models were bad but the environments were way better it definitely under delivered but not more than anthem or 76 king dom hearts 3 the starwars game with the redhead not with buying i really liked the game of thrones game actually lol hey watch dogs was great watch dogs was really good imho use me as a crackdown 3 button sorry for the long rant enjoy i think the reason 76 failed was due to its multiplayer style where instead it being a co op it was made a destiny w o w mmo which i dont care for personally and from a technical standpoint doesn t work with the style of game that fallout is just my opinion it would ve been better as a small borderlands co op style rpg since multiplayer was a must for 76 as for mass effect andromeda yes it was a bad game but i still liked it and yes i did play the entire trilogy before andromeda so no i m not one of those twats day 1 launch had major issues especially if you couldn t get that day 1 update like me at the time where it was literally such an unfinished game game as soon as you got to lvl 40 and the kadara poet section of the game the frame rate dropped to i kid you not 1 frame every 5 seconds and has issues to this day my main being the permanent cancellation of the quarian arc dlc but over all i still enjoyed it and can play it to this day just my personal input on that and i d say 76 should be in that top spot not andromeda and yes it is hard to redeem and stand up for andromeda seeing how they ripped off the plot and character cast of the first game but for it to have been developed by the mass effect3 multiplayer team that had no clue on storytelling and single player gameplay with the dreadful development time they were given with those knitwits at ea changing things halfway through the dev cycle they didnt do as bad as it could ve been and if given the proper time and funding it would ve been a good game that was their own take on the mass effect series if anything dont blame the game or bioware who s been crying for help for years blame ea the greedy twats i wouldn t put anthem at 1 it appealed to everyone across platforms except nintendo and was just such a huge flop more so also because it was a new ip with unlimited potential whereas fallout 76 and mass effect are games people already had expectations for i d put anthem 1 fallout 2 and mass effect 3 i agree with top 3 just not the order i loved the watch dogs story a gritty chicago hacker tracks down his daughter s killer to get revenge only to find out that his old friend and partner was involved at least watch dogs 2 is amazing tho mafia 3 just cause 4 the game was a let down and just cause 3 was way better how did evolve not make the list i forgot how much i hate these types of videos not gameranx s fault totally mine but i just find these videos so much of a downer the only thing i don t agree with is anthem what andromeda worse than anthem and fallout 76 dude are you drunk gameranx d brink was such a big dissapointment you even forgot to put it in the video you also should ve included honorable mentions putting andromeda on the list past spot 5 is just wild didnt they fix andromeda with patches i hate that i have given mass effect andromeda multiple attempted playthroughs and quit midway each time it s just so boring and bland i have to force myself to play it and it is not worth the effort i very much enjoyed watch dogs how was halo odst not on here 2 32 wtf is this mate yo honestly bro i didn t like skateboarding games at all but we need a skate 4 it s sad that bioware made 2 of the top 3 worst games im honestly surprised no man s sky on release wasnt on this list i can t believe people think the last season of game of thrones was bad it didn t end in a good way ugh lol pussies a population of fucking morons mafia 3 and assassin s creed 3 in time i learned to love both but daaamn did they look like they would be game of the year before they came out anthem for sure was my biggest disappointment that game had sooooo much potential to be good the division it was good but was plagued with bugs and glitches and equipment just not doing what they said they did the second game still has bugs going in and now there is an infinite damage glitch that they can t seem to fix even after 2 server maintenances and a title update destiny anthem no man s sky andromeda evolve titanfall watch dogs colonial marines destiny is also one that barely qualifies as it has a loyal playerbase but so does 76 it still got a colossal amount of hate when it came out i was expecting to see mgs 5 here for some reason good thing i didn t xd even though watch dogs got a huge downgrade i really loved the gameplay and story the multiplayer was really fun too and yep the driving did suck overall i think it got to much hate and that s why the sequel was way less serious and was kinda boring in comparison because of all the complaints am i the only one who liked watchdogs i still play watch dogs 1 too this day great story and there was nothing wrong with the voice acting like at all why is warcraft reforged not there it should be in the first what about halo 5 mass effect andromeda is still to this day the only game i went to a midnight release for i ve never been more disappointed plz don t bully me but i never played a mass effect so falcon sounds uhh sober xd felt like no man s sky should of been here how is no man s sky not on this list i m surprised battlefront 2 wasn t in here i t wasn t bad at launch but definitely wasn t what it should for could have been no crackdown 3 i actually enjoyed the mass effect game rage 2 should be on this no mans sky too predictable for this list why did you not mention no mans sky that should be number one metal gear solid v the division were incredibly disappointing to me gt sport is very dissapointing and every need for speed games ea number 1 at being the worst where s no man s sky i not fallout 76 and refunded it 20 minutes after play the game the forest it s a great game it adds both horror and survival elements and it s really fun the story makes you keep going and it can leave you sitting on your chair for hours or make you rage at 10 minutes it s a great survivor game better than fallout and it s on sale for 10 so go get it the game got better are you saying fable 3 is the best fable screams in sparrow my biggest disappointment ever was the division man i still love the game they were trying to make us believe would exist it never did a bit surprised no mans sky at launch didn t make the list you missed no man s sky watch dogs was good actually i have never played any mass effect do it do the trilogy you ll love the story and the characters mafia 3 i tried multiple times to get into it i loved the mafia series but it was an unrequited love bring back the skate games i met a developer of anthem and he said they felt good about it dragon age 2 i disagree with some of those games fallout 76 should have been 1 anthem 2 andromeda 3 fallout 76 barely worked anthem was a new cool idea that people hoped was good andromeda we new was gonna be different than the real mass effect games so yes was a big dissapointment but i would say not as big as the other 2 oh yea forgot if this was my list i would have put skyrim at 10 was a good game but overall boring and dissapointing feels more like a downgrade from morrowind and oblivion i feel like everyone already knows anthem is on this list wtf you forgot ac unity andromeda is worst then fallout 76 you sure what if id made a duke nukem game anthem reminds me of the ps 2 era game tribes aerial assault it s like they tried to remake it and failed hard still waiting for the vita version of mighty number 9 if you talking about the version that is dropped on release then no mans sky fallout 76 batman arkham knight pc the new battlefront 1 guess i will see anthem and andromeda in this list i fully enjoyed watchdog s watch dogs isn t a bad game i liked it or it s da i have a dark sense of humor hello i know this is pretty random but which nintendo switch game should i get astral chain zelda breath of the wild other i still liked watch dogs1 more than the 2nd cringe fest i want the wd1 vibes with wd2 innovation game of thrones as a whole was probably the biggest disappointment in entertainment history imagine a good game of thrones game but now that doesn t even matter because the ending of the story was just so garbage it just ruined it got went from being one of the greatest fantasy stories of all time imo to mediocre it s real sad for me you know it s a bad game when it reaches it s 10th gameranx bad games list lol watchdogs anthem whats the background music 5 20 i was so hyped for watch dogs i thought no mans sky would be on this not to defend andromeda but the ships headed to andromeda left before the reaper invasion also the multiplayer was pretty fun fallout 76 got better in my opinion with the recent updates its only boring to me when i dont have my buddies online to bs with and shit gravity guy 4 what exactly were people hyped for with fallout 76 i don t understand i kinda expected no mans sky to be on this list because it basically flopped oi yall forgot life i don t think the original watchdogs is that bad was i the only one waiting for crackdown 3 to appear on this list every ubisoft game post chaos theory how was no man s sky not on this list don t forget about ffxv no mans sky no man sky rip no wonder ubi is giving watch dogs for free sea of thieves was disappointing but then redeemed itself i feel like watch dogs original is better than a lot of people think like i definitely respect people not liking it but i think it gets a worse rap than it deserves watch dogs was a great game even if some claim it was overhyped for me it was a fantastic experience darkdr1fter it was ok but if they had pulled off what was promised in that demo it would have been amazing its a stupid fun game darkdr1fter same i love the game but i was definitely still expecting more from it echo x i liked it but 2 was better i think it is because i don t watch any game trailers yeah it was great i don t get people that bitch about graphics trevor grover i dont care about graphics but i do care about not getting what was advertised i get changes happen but in many games theres too much change gta v is an example with promised story dlc go watch the original e3 gameplay it got a massive fucking downgrade which would actually not be too bad if what s his name aiden wasn t such a generic boring edgy protagonist his entire character can be summarized into 1 sentence that perfectly describes him read this in batman s voice i didn t ask for this and with that you know exactly what kind of character he is i found watch dogs 1 better than 2 from the story and watch dogs 2 better than 1 from thr gameplay but i enjoyed 1 more bc it has a good story twixx 1 100 agreed it wasn t bad but it wasn t horrible one of the things that dragged the game down was aiden he was so fucking annoying zombifiedkilla what was advertised is actually in the game you can unlock that graphic with a mod but its too heavy it lag everyone s pc so they have to downgrade it maybe they thought the graphic is ok until they developed it further and the graphic need to be downgraded holo the story of the first watch dog is actually quite good revenge driven story and with a clear goal instead of the sequel that just like hell yea im a cool kid i can hack this and that well for watch dogs its disappointing but i stil spent over 500 hours on it lol dude colonial marines is not a bad game actually pretty much id say myself i enjoyed it even the last few years have made sure i will never pre order a game ever again this shits burned into my memory too badly fable started tosuck when they to morality out of it i mean the halo and horns aspect honestly i played mass effect andromeda a year after release and it was a pretty good game i don t know what s everyone s problem it sure wasn t as good as the trilogy but it wasn t bad either bo4 was a disappointing game to me because it s just not as good as bo1 and 2 were anyone else agree with me everybody s face in that game looked like they got hit with frying pan just before they walked before camera that s a perfect and hilarious line to describe mass affect andromeda facial animation wd1 is actually pretty good idk why they put out that trailer that lied so much why it just hurt the watch dogs name it made ppl not buy wd2 which is actually extreamly good like mechanic wise and freeroam wise its more fun than gta5 no man s sky was a huge letdown and didn t live up to the hype mafia 3 also just cause 4 star wars battlefront ii and no mans sky although swbf2 is an amazing game now and sea of thieves sea of thieves is also an amazing game now as well kingdom hearts 3 ff15 i do not think mass effect andromeda belongs number one on the list i brought the power armour edition of fallout 76 and i have never regretted anything as much andromeda was kinda fun imo completed watch dogs tho it seems it had its chance to be greater aliens colonial marines will never buy a game from randy bitchford gearbox ever again f ck borderlands mass effect 1 remake when i loved andromeda best cover system 3 52 it should say book of thrones atlas and wildcard who made ark survival evolved i honestly love watch dogs no destiny shit even destiny 2 can make it on this list my biggest regret is buying witcher 3 watch dogs 2 rise of the tomb raider and not buying god of war forgot god of war and horizon zero dawn complete crap didn t finish either one uninstalled i was a huge fan of every god of war game before but this last one was trash johnny love your opinions are in the minority mass effect andromeda after fallout 76 and anthem what the fuck are you guys smoking battlefield 5 correct list of most disappointing games in the last 10 years 1 metal gear solid 5 2 bioshock infinite 3 final fantasy 15 4 kingdom hearts 3 5 shenmue 3 6 mass effect andromeda 7 fallout 76 8 anthom 9 mighty number 9 10 watchdogs evolve modern warfare 2020 all halos after halo reach were trash i mean halo 4 was ight because of editor and the fact it has turrets and u could just muck around with mates on it but omg was halo 5 terrible the original fable was my favorite played it three times fable 2 twice have got into the others didn t like controls surprised no man s sky wasn t a big one you forgot kingdom hearts 3 kingdom hearts 3 just like final fantasy xv was total trash kingdom hearts iii detroit become human was fairly dissapointing considering it looked stunning and had a really great base for a better developable story line yaaay theres no absolute zombies wandering down here saying battlefront 2 over and over again identity they promised a lot of things but i miss like games from when skyrim and gta came out and then that huge early access boom i seriously can t find any games that interest me anymore i m still playing skyrim in 2020 just got the forest and started playing with a friend i wish there were some new games that were actually exciting i mean dying light 2 looks good but it s a sequel so u can only hope tor so much the division was almost nothing like it s lead up it was poised to be a squad based survival game with interesting limited not simple or unvaried loot where the struggle to survive was intense and every new interaction would be different literally as soon as fo76 was announced my very first thought was that will be an unmitigated dumpster fire thats how i felt to but my friends still wanted to get it and they wonder why im so pessimistic about games at 12 06 a persons head almost goes 360 assassins creed unity has anyone seen fallout shelter online on android but it s not from bethesda and saints row 4 come to think of it watch dogs watch dog 2 aw come one were my wife and i the only people who enjoyed andromeda i even consider the me trilogy one of my top five favorite games series oh well i m just gonna go i think you missed destiny 2 it might be better now but if your talking about in the last ten years the initial release and dlcs were huge disappointments aw fable 3 broke my heart i was so disappointed with it gta iv similarly niko no no ac unity i still have nightmares andromeda s a good game i loveeeee fable 3 lmao obsidians outerworlds should be 1 games a bad ripoff of borderlands and ot is there fault for the hype they knew that game wasnt complete yet they released it anyways if mass effect andromeda doesn t make number one a war crime would be committed expected no man s sky i would put fallout 76 on number 1 as for duke well i think the biggest mistake was comparing it to other modern fps games of the time it was never meant to be a cod competitor or any other game competitor it was meant purely as a relaxed tongue in cheek arcadey fps with a well known over the top macho hero reminiscent to the good old times of 90 s innovation and experiments the game doesn t take itself seriously and no one should take it seriously they should just play it have a laugh at the ridiculously over the top personality and entertain themselves for a while division 2 anyone gameranx top ten most disappointing games of the decade fallout 76 hold my merchandise hold my subscription andromeda was number 1 how can you place anything other than fallout 76 as number 1 from fake private servers to failed merch associated with the game 15 seconds in how fast till i hear the name anthem edit 8 58 that s how long how is no mans sky not on here especially not at 1 agents of mayhem was a huge disappointment for me where is sonic the headghog 2006 duke nukem forever for what it was and for the hell it went through was pretty awesome i mean not 60 dollars awesome but like half price awesome i immediately stopped caring the moment mass effect andromeda was put as more of a disappointment as fallout 76 i have 3 playthroughs of mea i absolutely loved it did it have problems yes but it was not more of a disappointment than f076 watch dogs 1 was a shit ton better than the sequel i have hopes for wd legion but after 2 i have doubts saints row 4 because i m a mass effect fanboy i ve played the original trilogy 3 times about to start my fourth i ve played andromeda twice one time each sibling then trade the game in while it still had value the character development was lacking the story was very meh the thing that really bothers me the most is how we travel to a brand new galaxy and we only have two new races and one of them happens to be the villain i will say the gameplay mechanics were pretty good in andromeda i would say the best out of any mass effect game i think the next mass effect game should be a survivalist story they pick up at the end of the reaper war with a hybrid of the reapers wiped out majority of the population and combining synthetic life worked looked at this list on my recommend and knew without a doubt that before i watched it that watch dogs was on the list i was correct actually if you manage to find all of alec ryder s log in mass effect andromeda you learn that there was a third party who s basically a knock off of the shadow broker from the original trilogy that funded the andromeda project because he feared they wouldn t survive the reaper attack and what do you know canonically shepard loses once you stop and think about it everything that s cool about this game came from the original trilogy and everything that s original sucks hey you guys forget the warcraft refunded it was disappointing looking at the score where is crackdown 3 the glaring one for me is destiny now all you youngins say hey i love that game go back and watch the original e3 gameplay reveal massive disappointment what most people are saying about destiny is that it is a good game not in the past it had very little content at the start but turned into something great i remember them saying it was a massive open world imagine my surprise when i learned 70 of the game was locked off and the world wasn t really open you didnt play the original gameplay reveal lol and yeah i feel like destiny should ve been on there i love destiny but it did not fulfill its promises brian i mean yeah your right lol both destiny s had so very little content at launch i m so glad they were able to revive both games with a good amount of content throughout the years i agree now destiny is an ok game a pretty standard fps however it is by far the most overhyped game ever the demo beta whatever it was was better than the game perfect list then i remembered crackdown 3 for me it was far cry 3 there is no game on the planet that is begging for a better remake than aliens colonial marines wwe 2k20 i haven t seen the video yet but i m positive it includes no man s sky honestly as a huge mass effect fanboy probably my favorite game franchise seeing how andromeda turned out so bad still breaks my heart battlefront 2 was also a disappointment wait what where s hunt down the freeman 8 35 wtf lol btw what about no mans sky s first release everyone on earth got mad that day i kind of liked andromeda never got the weird face glitches everyone was talking about other than the terrible jokes and falling through the world a few times it was a pretty solid game me too but i faced a glitch so bizarre my character were running around nude i am surprised no man sky wasnt on this this with a caveat that it got good and i mean really became a good game surprised no mans sky didn t make the list the guy talking sounds like every wining idiot on the internet complaining about every damn aspect of a game that s why devs just give up lolforallintentsandpurposes fable3isareallygoodgame the wounds inflicted to my soul by me andrameda still haven t healed to this day i just want a good me game again it s been years how about rainbow six siege i mean the trailer and the game are like night and day and in the trailer there were even doors also the trailer looked like it was animated so its probably not even from the game battlefront 2 is an ok game but dice just never releases stuff we ask for modders do more work than the entire company has ever done on the game i felt like watchdogs was a rebadged far cry you always mention watch dogs but hardly talk about the division it a bigger rip off in my opinion i ve been waiting for cyberpunk 2077 since 2007 it s been 13 years where the game at lol how i felt about fallout 76 coming out was probably about what my parents felt when i came out you guys are keeping me sane during quarantine thank you no man sky rdr2 was a phenomenal game but from the trailers it seemed like that you could instigate and start heists of whatever with whomever whenever wherever this is not the case gemberkoekje from the cinematic trailers anthem looked so cool biggest waste of 60 dollars ever what about generation zero i was so damn hyped for it and the game just well it sucks you know what s better then 76 there is a couple of people who made a project called skyrim together and yes its multiplayer skyrim nah dude fable 3 is just bad not even an ok rpg haven t finished yet but anthem better be on this list i hope that blue protocol wont be a huge flop cause im hyped for it idk if this a big game or not but you forgot atlas i actually loved aliens colonial marines kind of expected final fantasy 15 evolve and no man s sky in this list guest they just faded into obscurity after all the hours of disappointed content they left on yt i was expecting kingdom hearts 3 every game in 2020 maybe i m bias but i acually liked andromeda it wasn t as good as the trilogy but thats seriously a tough level to reach anyways it definetly deserved a spot here tho because of the shitshow that was it s launch but in my opinion fallout 76 was way way worse wheres metal gear survive to be fair that was going to be a failure before launch destiny should ve been on this list 9 15 speaking of looter shooters destiny 1 and 2 were both disappointing at least to me they both got to a point that i loved them hell i used to run weekly raids in d1 with the same crew for a while but at launch both were just lacking nowhere near as disappointing as this list but still not worth the money imo its a shame too because looter shooters are one of my favorite types of games but with so many recently being bad i ve come to the point where the only looter shooter i will buy early or without reading reviews is borderlands you know they actually improved on andromeda over time i knew anthem was a risky buy when i got it but that did not prepare me for the bizarre experience that the game turned out to be it was like bioware made an incoherent single player experience that ea then frankensteined together with an incomplete concept for an mmo it was so fascinatingly underwhelming i kind of feel bad for the devs that spent much of their time making such a dreadful game fallout seventy shit x two gun thing is something ripped from halo what i m surprised no mention of destiny 1 at launch evolve or no mans sky funny ahha i was gonna mention these three before i saw you beat me my god that was a brutally depressing list of games just shaking my head from thinking how excited i was for all of them sheesh this is one of the worst lists of a video like this hype if you buy into it you deserve the end results dark souls after all the hype i expected something much better than a rather bland series of fights with little lore and a pretty naff story along with content hidden that you need a wiki to find the whole soulsborne series are massively overrated ok but like no man s sky see i argue against me a being 1 yeah it rebooted the usual end of the universe story but it was a great game at the core combat was fun and diverse they had every bug that every other me game had yet the drama was insane the me a hate was absolutely unfounded it was on par with me2 and blew me3 out of the water for reference me1 i have 300 hours me2 100 me3 maybe 6hrs me a is 60 hrs still have another play through to do you could make a whole video about the lies and disappointment of star citizen fable 2 was way better then 3 why aren t no mans sky or star wars battlefront 1 or 2 on the list no man sky wow no man s sky wasn t in here i m suprised 99 off these i do not know bioware just got fkd by ea not that sure about anthem 2 0 being that much better later on they should rather move away from ea and join a better publisher with aliens cm we can blame timegate cause they were the ones that kept changing the game story for me it the biggest disappointment was warcraft iii reforged i usually don t get hyped for new releases because i have an extensive backlog of games to play but this game i was hyped for because i was going to be playing it with friends needless to say the release was an unfinished buggy disaster of a game they managed to fool me with all that false advertisement and it was terrible no man s sky no the division wasn t a disappointment i was so disappointed that it still pisses me off it changed the gaming industry because since then they know we are to be fucked with content and money wise it deserves 1 on this list you guys could make an entire video about how disappointing that game was fallout 76 anthem and mass effect andromeda are better than this channel why warcraft iii reforged isn t in the list not so much of a disappointment ubisoft doesn t know what they re doing anymore really running out of ideas feel like this gets re hashed every couple of months number 6 watch dogs 5 15 i see where your coming form about the down grade and how ubi lied but the last part about how there were to many invisible walls and bad voice acting is just petty the invisible walls sometime appear but what you showed was just you trying to exit the map so much for to many invisible walls and there s no bad dialogue in the game there may be bad facel animation in the game we can t forget ubi made this and artificial intelligence isn t really intelligence at this point your just trying to make the game look bad it s a 2013 game trying to make someting out of a hacking idea like being able to get a description on a npc or hack into someone house and see a bit of their daily life ubi did lie about some game features like the graphics and bounty hunters but that doesn t make the game trash there s still stuff you can enjoy sorry had make a whole paragraph but i just had to point out on this and how the game has been kicked in the dirt by many people and how ubi lied about it eh wtf dude fable 3 was nothing like 1 or 2 definitely not the same game 3 times it was incredibly linear boring and had like a 5 hour campaign fable 1 was groudbreaking fable 2 took the formula of 1 and made it even better fable 3 took the aesthetics and story of 1 2 and made a boring generic and linear version of it no man s sky surprised to not see no man s sky the game they completely changed due to the lies and disappointment wow it s like you read my mind never even opened up the new mass effect and i was a die hard fan street fighter v twisted metal halo 5 destiny socom 4 star wars battlefront assassin s creed iii batman arkham knight i know most of these were solid in their gameplay but considering their history they were disappointing for me borderlands 3 dissapointment the hate on dnf is a little much it was a competent fps with dated crass humor essentially an upgrade from it s past editions they weren t amazing guys they were simple doom clones that just had a lot of stuff in them that was taboo and caught people s attention what did people expect half life 3 final fantasy 15 should have definitely been on this list game was ass compared to final fantasy 13 it was a masterpiece that s the real stinker of the bunch and it turned into a friggin trilogy it s seen in a more positive light than not i m expecting kingdom hearts 3 not a bad game just disappointing in the story departmentn i didn t mind andromeda destiny 2 was missing from your list lol ok mass effect andromeda gets way too much hate after the patches it s actually a really solid game 8 out of 10 easy destiny 2 that duke theme i loved duke nukem on the 360 no hunt down the freeman 15098598 10 unwatchable instantly unsubscribing dis liking with my 70 alternative accounts quit hating on fallout 76 your doing it because its a meme it will make a comeback just like eso mass effect andromeda isn t nearly as bad as people make it out to be the combat was great fun and it had some of the most beautiful environments of any game i ve ever played lmfao the combat is garbage and the game is even worse than people make it out to be completely agree mass effect andromeda is better than ppl give it credit for graphics were better combat was energetic and fun and i never had any of the weird rotating head and clipping issues ppl bash this game for had some really great battles that made you feel like a tenno from warframe smdh that ms andromeda was number 1 i m sure but can you say the same for them faces tho yes bc i laughed my ass off at those faces if it entertains me it s getting the job done i don t need all video game characters to look like greek gods my character was a ginger had an afro and looked like his face had caved in from getting punched really effing hard every cutscene was pure laughing gold shane skyrunner it is as bad as people make it out to be bad story bad animation there s a reason why it went down to 7 bucks barely a year after it came out wrong i still say andromeda was a great game i didn t play it until maybe a year after it released so it was patched well before i got to it but i m a budget gamer waited till it was 15 on black friday and i spent close to 180 hours playing it so it doesn t live up to expectations or come close to being as good as the original trilogy i strongly believe price is a huge factor with the enjoyment of games these days and for 15 andromeda was a great bit of fun for me halo ce didn t have dual wielding h2 did i wonder if anthem is on this list where was mafia3 it was total dissapointment graphicly rly good but story and everything else was extremly bad how was no man s sky not on this list i liked duke nukem don t get me wrong it s bad but i like turning my brain off and enjoying duke spit lines and shooting aliens i didn t even know a got rpg existed lol halo 5 was disappointing the last guardian the witcher 3 legend of zelda botw horizon zero dawn come fight be i m practicing social distancing as a massive zelda fan the lack of themed dungeons and unique bosses as well as the final boss becoming easier it was good just not as amazing and perfect as it had the potential to be where is dayz no man s sky number 1 should be raid shadow legends because that games hyped up by every single youtuber and it turns out its just trash i personally love fable just saying mass effect andromeda wasn t that bad i played it after all the bugs had been fixed i liked it never knew why there was so much hate fallout 76 anthem i understand but not me a lol never played any of these games i would like to play fallout 4 but its bugthesda it just feels dirty i really loved andromeda but that s just me i can tell i would put f76 above it though we ve seen that shit show just get worse day after day fable 3 was bad for me massively disappointed by kingdom hearts 3 to wait so long and have such a rush average game was heartbreaking i d say destiny don t get me wrong the gameplay and design was spot on it s just it launched incomplete it caught up eventually though you were right on i played a lot of them and some i just said to with then and didn t bother to finish assassins creed unity am i a joke to you with the first watch dogs ubisoft nailed the atmosphere but the gameplay sucked with watch dogs 2 it was the other way around classical ubisoft i ve only ever got to play mass affect 3 i think and that s about it everyone seems to dislike them beyond 3 so i ve always been skeptical in trying them honestly for me watch dogs ain t a disappointment though i kinda agree that the graphics when compared to the demo was a let down why people still complain about alien colonial marines without considering the collectors edition which is almost the same as in the trailer is beyond me where is no man s sky my favorite part about fable 3 was the picture of big bessie bbws are underrated it really bugs me how cool the environment of fallout 76 is since its in that game we ll probably never get to see it in a good main release now what a waste okay so i agreed with everything on this list except mass effect andromeda honestly i never understood why it got so much hate don t get wrong the original trilogy is far superior but that s not to say that andromeda was bad yeah it had a bumpy release but what can you honestly expect when bioware was super rushed to just push the title out maybe i m just being a fanboy but i genuinely enjoyed me a not to mention the actual gameplay aspect of andromeda is so much more fun than the original trilogy in my opinion this isnt a list of the shittiest games of the decade but the most dissapointing ones play the og trilogy then play andromeda and then try saying it wasnt dissapointing before i watch the video i bet i already know all of these games fallout 76 is my favorite game to hate because when it first released it was just another bad game we could ve moved on and forgotten about it but then bethesda kept making it worse no matter what they did whether that was the legal issues regarding the bonus content the patches that somehow made the game more broken or the blatantly greedy and utterly failed attempt to capitalize on a paid subscription fee it s like the game was already a train wreck but bethesda kept sending more trains to crash into it that is what made it so infamous i ll give a pretty good game that is pretty cool right now but slow as heck on development been following since 2018 and that is valheim in theory it is a badass viking sandbox but you really have to play it to see what i mean fallout is quite good now and it s going to get better with the new update cod ghosts halo 5 where is evolve lawbreakers and no man s sky wtf mafia 3 is one that really let me down for the record i highly recommend watch dogs 2 even if you hated the first one suprised no mans sky wasn t on the list i m surprised no man s sky wasn t even mentioned grand theft auto v wow bfa three words no mans sky i woulda made a different list for sure more fps shooters i am a simple man i see a video dissing watch dogs i dislike halo 5 guardians made me truly hate it for false advertising the story andromeda wasn t that bad enough already fallout 76 was way worse where is destiny 2 you know what i d forgotten about andromeda cos of fallout 76 and wow what a reminder i hate duke nukem because he s mean to today s girls i was 100 sure no man s sky was 1 didn t even mentions it when it released it had to be one of the most disappointing games of all time warcraft 3 refunded is not on the list let s be honest we all knew fallout 76 was going to be trash when first announced in the e3 i think we all thought it was gonna be bad but at least not that bad holy hell nah a lot of people were hyped william stfu skull phantom i won t take that like shut the f up but i will take it as samurai training finished unsuccessfully nah we thought it was gonna be great but eh its still good when it was announced i actually really liked the idea and was kinda excited then it was announced there was going to be no human npcs then the cluster fuck of the beta started then the game launched with a lot of issues and i lost all interest i find watch dogs not disappointing at all it s pretty great actually i seem to recall there was an article about that aliens game having 1 simple typo in the code that disabled the aliens ai features making them terrible if that s true and that typo never happened in an alternate reality perhaps that game wasn t as disappointing as it turned out in this one you guys forget about destiny or let s hope cyberpunk 2077 won t end up on a list like this lmao the first watch dogs was the best watch dogs cool protagonist evolve i m so surprised brink isn t on this list mass effect trilogy spent hundreds of hours on it fell in love with the characters finished the game mass effect andromeda played almost half way got bored never finished it i bought the game thinking maybe it isn t as bad as people say i stopped playing 7 hours in same i really wanted to finish it but could just never get into it same here two gun carrying love the vid some of these pisses me off it s mostly factual but some games this guy just used opinions to talk about them rdr2 i didn t like fable 3 it felt off compared to the 2 others i had fun on duke nukem forever to mea defences the game start before the event of me2 and cerberus probably had something to do with that just excited days gone isn t here it s a great game that doesn t deserve the hate i ve replayed several times enjoyably it was challenging and good the first time updates made the normal and hard settings too easy by making bad gear better thankfully they countered it by adding even more difficulties i tried might no 9 when i first got my ps4 as it was free with ps that month or the one after and dear god the game crashes non stop and it had been out for years at this point also fable 3 s sameness isn t something i dislike what i dislike is the progression being sudden and without warning and everyone else i ve known that disliked fable 3 say the same about how progression is handled and nothing about how the story or gameplay is the same that being said i didn t play all the fable games at launch back then and there s several year gaps between my playing fable 1 at 14 it was my 14th birthday present and the game had been out a few years at this point but i got it for pc with halo on pc as well and then fable 2 i got when i was 18 19 and fable 3 i played more recently when i was 25 i was expecting andromeda to be on the list the little that i played it i enjoyed besides the multiplayer the game s multiplayer was not designed well it was my first and so far only entry into the mass effect series that i ve played and i did try it a year and a half after it s release buddy game shared it to me and i plan on buying it but i enjoyed it and everything my buddy said was terrible about it i liked regarding gameplay mechanics besides how the cover system is god awful and pointless as it does nothing for half walls the rest of the games i can t defend but fable 3 and mass effect andromeda get too much flak for what they are game of thrones was a good game you were too kind on duke forever that game was an absolute train wreck and probably the worst if you throw in the fact we waited 15 years for the crap i like anthem its really fun i m so happy you put andromeda 1st because if you didn t this list would have been moot what a piece of shit that game was and so disappointing you left out the last of us while it presented itself as an open world game it was a trigger based game you know meaning that enemies would only spawn or battle would only end if you did the objective or walked to a certain point that was also the other big disappointment to aliens colonial marines you guys should do 10 games that delivered their promises i thought fallout 76 will be number one but i saw its actually the second then i thought no man sky will be the number one and i was suprised its not in the list by god andromeda was terrible like what was that the ubisoft video idk i think the andromeda was really good and the combat system was really really good but yes you have point that they don t finish the game it was still kind of the same game three times i m sorry what exactly about fable 2 is anything like fable did you even play the damn games is it bad i played watchdogs one to completion without knowing it was bad no and it s pretty good too disappointing doesn t mean it s bad when fallout 76 got number 2 i was like dang what could be worse oh yeah matt chambers lmao same i kinda like fallout 76 it got a lot better except fallout first people said that it was super laggy and the game was one of the worse game ever i decided to test it anyways guess what one of the best game i ever played and im not joking had so much fun and never even encountered a single bug after over 30 hours of play gabriel paradis yeah i like fallout 76 also gabriel paradis i liked fo76 also considering that it was bethesda s first try in making an online game with the fallout stuff it wasn t that bad even though there were some bugs in the beginning they were able to fix most of them and make an ok product siege should have been on this list i also expected days gone to be in the top 5 dude throw random memes in the middle of the video thats don t have to do with anything gonna throw it out there i think mea2 can be a thing but this time around more passion and less corporate crunching if anthem wasn t evolved mea coulda been the series we were looking for i trashed mea 2 years ago but im actually playing again despite criticism they just need the right people for it to work just remember that we still have the galaxy of andromeda to explore serios woch dogs i m surprised the division wasn t in here i agree with watch dogs 1 like bedbug was so annoying and i can t shoot from my car aiden drives with one hand and i can t shoot the sound was max but i can t hear shit aiden s character was a waste at that game i personally liked fallout 76 and mass effect andromeda bioware and bethesda it makes me so sad to say they occupy biggest disappointment slots that said am i the only one that thinks inquisition should have been here fallout 4 was the most disappointing game for me bio shock 2 while overall a really good game there is no way it could ve lived up to the original bioshock which is a certified masterpiece what pisses me off is bioware fucked over mass effect for anthem really really bad choice bioware what about outer worlds i was looking forward to it but it was such a disappointing game really every mission was roughly the same and the story took ages to progress nowhere fallout 76 should be number 1 you forgot mgs5 i hope cyberpunk 2077 doesn t make a similar list 10 years from now so where is no man s sky on this list you know mass effect andromeda takes place 600 years after me3 right the reaper war have long ended and surely have overcome the fallout number 2 and 1 should not be on this list they were great games the problem is the players not supporting the games causing them to fail blame the players not the games wait no mafia 3 that was the most disappointing pre order i ever got and it had so much potential mafia 2 is still better to play and that s over 10 years old fable 3 is fable 2 in hd fallout 4 was weak andromeda wasn t terrible it definitely was not anything compared to the first 3 so i understand why it was so disappointing to us all but it still wasn t bad thps5 is number 1 most disappointed i ve ever been in dark souls 2 all the bosses are very similar to one another and the level design isn t that great either it was very disappointing considering how great dark souls 1 is anthem i was kinda expecting to see rainbow six siege on here i love the game its just the trailer compared to the game had a huge graphics downgrade those top three they hurt me so much every one was a disappointment that stabbed me in the heart i still like watchdogs so much misinformation and myths in a single video metal gear 5 is up there too shitty repetitive missions boring open world neglecting the 1 continuous mission that made the series great no memorable bosses no ending wtf i forgot about mass effect andromeda i just took it for granted that no man s sky was 1 but it didn t even make the list damn man remember bioware i m so depressed right now lol you know i actually really enjoyed the first watch dogs it was a great game graphics arent that important to me so i was able to get over that fact very quickly and after that the game was just awesome before watching video let me say crackdown 3 and anthem nah everybody knew crackdown 3 was garbage fable 3 made me so mad it was so fucking awful it had less mechanics than an original xbox game i don t know how you do that i liked mass effect andromeda lol i m going to be honest watch dogs 1 is fun in my opinion and when it was announced i was fully aware of the infamous ubisoft downgrades so i didn t get disappointed also the mods for the game make it really fun too i was ok with playing mighty no 9 then again i didn t pay money for it i got it of ps plus yeah those games were shit weren t they lets goooo i have never even heard of this game of thrones rpg game till now i want to play it now falcon is such m a stupid name did you name yourself that lmao no mans sky the reason why first watchdogs game got downgraded was actually very simple and easy to find leadership inside ubisoft wanted to offer game on multiple platforms and they mandated that experience must be same for all versions and since consoles couldn t handle higher quality pc version got downgraded so it would match the experience console player would have so people wouldn t feel bad about getting inferior version that is it and command probably came in late hence why files were left in plus i would imagine some developers were bit pissed about how their hard work was basically wrecked and they knew if they leave files there someone will find them and fix the game and reason why this happens late in development cycle opposed through development is very simple too there is no point optimizing unfinished game where parts are constantly changing and you might spent weeks optimizing something that gets completely replaced or removed from the game so to not waste time they usually make the game then after things get finalized to an extent they start optimizing for various systems so they don t waste time doing things that might end up being useless so there you go whole mystery explained i thought halo 5 would be here since so many complained about its campaign being a whole other story i feel offended that mass effect andromeda was on thr 1 spot i actually really enjoyed the game so much that i replayed it multiple times with side quests idk what it is with fable but i really cant play anything other than the first game i have played it like 6 7 times already i lost count i tried playing fable 2 and 3 multiple times but those games just lost all the fun imo watchdogs was a great game i preordered the deluxe edition of andromeda i don t preorder things now the division ac unity battlefront 2 and need for speed as a series in every aspect during the last decade dragon age 2 i was kinda disappointed with dmc 5 good game but really not as good or as memorable as even the dmc 4 i hated keep finding gold orbs too common way too commonly found in game i was expecting no man s sky to be 1 fenrir i thought sea of thieves would be first i saw this exact thumbnail for a recent video which shows off a graphics mod with raytracing explaining it looked better than e3 s demo is that what brought this video to fruition give me a like if i m right if fallout 76 idea wouldve just been applied to fallout 4 it wouldve worked not online multiplayer like 76 just a simple option in fallout 4 to play the game with friends for every friend enemies get harder and v a t s is disabled it would be great drop in drop out on any one of your friends games if they want the only people that were hyped for anthem fallout 76 were complete morons that paid absolutely zero attention to how games are made and what the industry is up to ghost recon breakpoint needs to be here games in canada are 80 d not trying to stick up or anything but i just did try fallout 76 and it is better sw battlefront homefront revolution i personally would ve included destiny and the order 1886 the first destiny was awesome but paying 40e to start the game and another 40e to unlock the real game was annoying hmmm how many times will gameranx talk about watch dogs as an really bad game in a spect of graphics i agree but how many times will they mention that this is probably the 10th time you forgot dishonored 2 fallout 76 should be on this list 10 times lol you forgot fucking no man s sky personally i believe halo 5 should be on this list don t get me wrong halo 5 is a fun game and i even enjoyed some of the campaign but the story was nothing like how 343 made it seem the story focuses to much on new characters we really didn t care to play as halos master chief series is supposed to focus on him and his journey note that he is one of the most bad ass characters in video game history a lot of us expected an exciting and thrilling story but it wasn t the division definitely deserves a spot they sold a half done game you mean division 2 first one was at least a great start all the messing about with 2 well i gave up after months of we re going to change this and that and they re still changing it now shame i loved the game but no longer play it god i want anthem to be good the concept sounds so cool hopefully the overhaul actually delivers i enjoyed aliens tom clancy s the division i actually think fallout 76 is a pretty good game i found indigo prophecy to be pretty interesting when i ve played the demo but the final game ended up being trash destiny 2 at launch was my biggest disappointment it s much better now but i still never really got into it it s sad because i probably spent 1000 hours in the first game before watching i already foreshadow no mans sky somewhere in here edit why wasn t no mans sky on this halo 5 was very disappointing aight i hope they just leave fallout 76 as the bad game that it is and make a fallout 5 that took everything from the previous games except 76 and it ll be alright no no mans sky i know it was improved but based on how much of a wet fart it was at release i think it should be here watch dogs was a great game ever thought it wasn t promised i might be different from most but i actually enjoyed mass effect andromeda in the end please add far cry to your list watch dogs was one of the single worst games i ve ever played ghost recon breakpoint i want another game like watch dogs 1 can i get the link to the watchdogs mod i have not started watching but if fallout 76 isn t here then this is a prank video say what you want about mass effect andromeda but i have yet to see something cooler than using push pull to basically launch someone into space the graphics were also beautiful other than the faces at times the story was fine and had some interesting beats to it that never got explored because all dlc was cut i would love to see a sequel at some point conversely a game like control won game of the year and i put that down after an hour because of how mind numbingly dull the gameplay was video was spot on i would have put anthem at the top of the list oh it was baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad i m not going to lie aliens colonial marines was so much fun with friends but it was still a pretty bad game i was gonna make a comment about crackdown 3 but it seems like i was the only person interested in that game and it s destructible environments kinda like old red guerilla games sad to see the failure it became who is hyped for half life 3 i can t wait for this finally valve comfired this i d add crackdown 3 yea it wasnt as big as the others but it was an exclusive title that people had been waiting on for a long time fallout 4 it came in after the witcher 3 and was a huge pile of shit in comparison fall out and mafia 3 fortunately i never bought fall out in high price but unfortunately for mafia 3 i paid full price when the game released me it s so easy to make lists like these this guy will probably just list a few games he didn t like an gameranx number 10 fable 3 me subscribes fooflinger i think am the only guy who likes fable 3 i think it s because the first time i try playing this genre but i remember loving it lol this is one of the better gaming channels on youtube you ve missed a wealth of useful information and opinions on upcoming games laymen gaming is also a very funny channel that is all live long and prosper fellow digital denizen nanu nanu etc enochofthenine i like laymen gamings other channel skillup step dad he literally said fable 3 was good in the video just not what was expected of it step dad fable 3 was cool i m playing through it again after like 10 years lol was a pretty big disappointment though enochofthenine a wealth of useful information and opinions is just in fact an opinion i would ve enjoyed fable 3 alot more if it wasn t so incredibly full of gamebreaking bugs when i played it enochofthenine yeah but a shit ton of throwing shit on battlefront 2 a fucking comback game like no mans sky that these dudes can not comprehend as being completely different from the mess they are imagining it to be you can t be disappointed for a game if you were never hyped for it i absolutely knew anthem was going to be a barebones rpg and still it managed to fall even flatter on it s face than expected it s ea ffs they don t care about making good games anymore just money aliens colonial marines i m calling it devastated me back in the day and still isn t fond to look back on same boycotted every gearbox title since not getting a penny i will say it mass effect andromeda is actually good after the fix gaems i don t ever remember duke nukem forever 2011 lol rip mass effect series mass effect 2 was a master piece i am playing through andromeda currently 50 hrs and i do see the problems but they are present in quite a lot of other games that have come out bland broken facial animations are somewhat present in say ac odyssey eyes flickering and inhuman contortions of their face but that game got to the game awards both have bloated worlds filled with somewhat meaningless side content however i feel that odyssey at least had better side quests than andromeda s task missions other than that i felt that in terms of story characters and bugs they were almost on par odyssey being more bearable just so happened to make it not receive as much backlash to me it doesnt change the fact that the focus in both was more content but not better content lol frying pan haven t watched it yet but if anthem mass effect a aren t in the top 3 i ll be surprised i was waiting for jump force most disappointing fighting game watchdogs used to be one of my favourite games until i started playing gta anthem will get better it has since launch and it will keep getting better not even started watching it yet i m already going to bet that no mans sky is on this list and time to press play well i was incorrect in my assumption so how many time can you milk watchdogs graphic down grade watch dogs was a great game for its time the graphics were very very nice and the game ran beautifully smooth story was alright the hacking was amazing i enjoyed it thoroughly unlocked everything in the game and even did multiplayer when i finished it it was fantastic idk what kind of hacking people expected it was a great game for 2014 i m not sympathetic to anyone who was disappointed by anthem the signs were always there from the moment it was announced that it was going to be a pos it s ea ffs witcher 3 god of war and doom eternal are most disappointing games ever they ended total war rome 2 was so bad at release it was huge dissaponintment watch dogs is one of my favorite open world games even knowing all the bad critics i still don t think that watchdogs at least on pc and the current gen consoles was anywhere near as bad as what you people claim they removed some effects on ps3 and x360 because those couldn t pull it off and yes it was downgraded even on pc but demo s are usually like that for marketing purposes and more importantly the final game still looks good it actually looks considerably better than gta v it s not as fun as gta v but as far a graphics go it s extremely and weirdly underrated ok but where tf is destiny and no man s sky damn im surprised crackdown 3 didnt make the list probably because there wasn t massive hype especially after crackdown 2 you should trim your pubes hair i think your broom needs a new pole max 117 uh yes there was lol look that picture watch dogs was truth the truth didn t look bad and was a good game i m lost to yal beef with that game aiden was bitter ok so what he was suppose to be i loved watch dogs personally i m just being honest i stopped playing games in general and when i do end up playing a few it s usually indie games like rimworld or stardew valley that offer so much for so little stardew valley fable iii was just trash the damn sancutary for the options the microtransactions broken gameplay overpowered magic dog a i was dumb boss fights were anticlimactic need i go on i don t know i actually kinda liked it it was my first xbox game man u dumb it was amazing hey hey hey hey fallout 76 is good ok and just cause they didn t add npcs does not mean that it s bad ok and at least bethesda is fixing it with a story give them credit for at least bringing a story what s fallout 76 me we don t talk about that game it s not bad just boring blacksmith hero7 its comin back just hope it makes it to another fallout better game i wasn t disappointed with fallout 76 my expectations were already pretty low it s gotten way better with the dlcs if y all haven t already played it outerworlds is a better fallout game than any that bethesda will ever make friend let s play fallout 76 because its fallout but multiplayer me it saddens me to think how quickly we resort to fallout 76 shut up dude stop hating on fallout 76 it s at least trying to fix itself cut it some slack bro come on mass effect andromeda was a good game crackdown 3 if no man s sky ain t here you guys keep forgetting crackdown 3 6 just made me remember that ubisoft i believe made a statement saying they didn t want to make a superior pc version that looked waay better than the console version and made the choice to downgrade it not a game but my sister i still have a crush on peebee jump force was absolute shit too duke nukem forever had the same type of humor as saints row but with gameplay like bulletstorm wrong way around as saints row came out after duke which had the 80 90s humour they should have updated along with the graphics suck my boomstick classic one liner from duke just for nostalgia fable 3 kinda was bad at least compared to 1 2 and i actually liked watch dogs claytalian well there s your problem right there fable 3 was great watch dogs wasn t but then again i really liked me andromeda so i mean am i the only one who enjoyed andromeda which fallout 76 dlcs are you referring to that they try to fleece people with i m honestly surprised that metal gear survive was not on the list yeah that actually looked good if it werent for the fact that most of the game is fighting zombies with a stick it would seem every companies down fall to their game begins with being rushed it s too corporate now the big main developers in these large companies are trying to pump out games like an assembly line slow down falcon you are a genius borderlands 3 cube world god damn i miss mass effect bring in back even though people hate mass affect andromeda so much i actually enjoyed playing it even though people hate wiping their asses with pinecones so much i actually enjoy it watchdogs was such a fun game anthem better be on this list mass effect was fixed and was updated to 4k visuals eventually story wasn t that bad imo watch dogs was good they must have locked them files away because they couldn t be compressed for consoles wolfenstein 2 should be on this list a personal game that should be here is ride 3 ride 2 was fantastic and then milestone just ruined the 3rd mass effect andromeda i feel like im the only person who enjoyed andromeda seems like you read my comment on last video lol i mentioned these disapointments hahaha what a coincidence xd love what you guys do falcon you da man bioware better be going balls to the wall with the next dragon age like hardd watch dogs had a lovely story but i despised the graphics and few of the gameplay i haven t even watched this yet but fallout 76 anything by ubisoft apex legends because it wasn t titanfall 3 not really destiny 2 but still you need to but a separate dlc to basically play the game and the demo was so promising the 1001 glitches of fallout 76 highly reccomended destiny 1 was the ultimate letdown they promised 500 hours of gameplay and a completely open world both those things never came true i got bored of it within the first 2 3 hours and promised myself to always wait for reviews for a game i wanted anthem has good gameplay but not much beyond that i like to go back to it when i m between games mighty 9 was a good game i can t agree with you on that one rdr2 outdated gameplay and lock on mechanics gta5 outdated gameplay and lock on mechanics fallout 76 poop the last doom for trash multiplayer watchdogs buggy quake champions being load out based the last two splinter cell games extremely easy and boring the last two ghost recon games for being third person shooters again yup no man s sky was a massive flop fallout 76 should ve been an update for fallout 4 like gta 5 or rdr2 both have online and have access when u buy the game single player first and then they add it in for free mgsv anyone else only subscribed to this channel to watch falcon s vids no disrespect to the other members but i only find myself watching falcon s vids watch dogs was shit i was so disappointed in that game terrible disappointment ea is the worst game company in the world like activision am i the only one to point out they made bacicly the same video 6 months ago sonic forces falcon should stop making these top 10 disappointing videos cause i feel like he just gets sadder the more he has to be reminded of these games haven t watched but i m gambling that there are multiple ubisoft games on this list clicks play fallout 76 should have been first worst game ever fellout 69 i m surprised siege did make the list everytime someone mentions anthem i die a little more inside no man s sky it really wasn t everything promised i know that it was fixed after a while but after that disastrous launch i think it deserves to be in this list i may have to go back and play watch dogs after turning on all the graphics and see if it makes any difference i actually would have put fallout 76 at 1 anthem 2 andromeda 3 i would also have put no man s sky on the list it may have gotten better but i never went back to it i also would have put batman arkham knight on the list but then again we all knew fallout 76 and anthem were going to suck i didn t give them a dime on these 2 how dare watch dogs be the thumbnail we ve all played the mass effect series right me um no wow another andromeda is the worst game ever joke stunning and brave real original take yes it had many problems but got you act as tho it s unplayable you re going to discredit duke nukem for being able to carry two guns just because halo did it that literally makes no sense being able to have two guns in a first person shooter literally just make sense regardless goldeneye did it as well duke dukem was just too late we already plenty more of what it was and graphics definitely looked like 90 s graphics i almost bought alien colonial marine i almost bought alien colonial marine i got the crack version of it and oh boy you can t even pay me still to play it by the way do anthem and fallout 76 out yet duke forever was ok fun but long as hell i got my money worth halo 5 evolve jesus christ what the fuck was that game that s the first gameranx vid i disliked andromeda cmon brink should be on this list hope need for speed is in the video not on the list warframe a repetitive boring mess with poorly implemented ninja gaiden mechanics bad gunplay samey levels just disappointing in every respect this video should be called company s that are made for cash grabs i know i m probably in the minority with this but infamous second son it was a good game it was just so disappointing and no one seems to mention this compared to the first two halo 5 guardians is my most disappointing game of the last decade purely because of how awful the story was the plot was bad sure but the multiplayer was amazing every halo after 3 and gta v you forgot sonic boom i liked andromada 8 40 if you want a 2d game of that style a good alternative is my friend pedro on pc black ops 4 titanfall it was good but way over hyped my life suck i have 4 of those games fallout 76 watchdogs anthem mass effect andromeda 2 bioware games who would have believed it back then watch dogs i loved mighty number 9 i mean yeah it wasn t the best game but it was still fun i dare say part of the disappointment is people saw it as the successor to mega man it was it s own game one with promise and a challenge sure the bosses are hard as hell and some things seem kinda iffy but i still had fun with it suprised that og destiny didn t make the list i disagree with you on watch dogs 1 watch dogs was still good even if it didn t live up to what was shown johnny miller i think watch dogs is the true example of how damaging to your game overhyping it can be if they didn t say anything special about the game it would ve felt a masterpiece i agree with you man i played the whole story and it was good but in watch dogs 2 i didn t like that they took away the awesome enforcers from the 1st watch dogs game they were way more better looking and how they sounded with their mask on they were more threatening and more dangerous looking the retail version of watch dogs 1 was a huge let down most of that game s profits can be attributed to their highly effective and misleading marketing campaign and pre release gameplay exactly bro nah i felt ripped off i liked it but i bought because i wanted to get what i saw watchdogs 2 made up for it though i thought immaeatcookies that goes to kingdom hearts 3 yeah i loved watch dogs jam rock definitely cooldude468 the enforcers ruin police shootouts the only thing that can take them down is explosives the grenade launcher and the destroyer also the takedown works but the animation goes on for to long in my opinion correction for duke nukem it is the definition of development hell unpopular opinion but honestly final fantasy 15 like the music was great everything else was kinda meh it s very irresponsible for somebody to suggest we can have a pc running windows and get up from it and do other things the microsoft co founder said in an interview with bob on tuesday what we need is an extreme shutoff so that in six to 10 weeks if things go well then maybe you will have taken the trash that s been piling up for the last two decades or so out of your house the division 1 graphics look nothing like the first gameplay yeah they need to replay some of these fallout 76 is gonna be much better on the 14th of april no one cares f76 is the biggest pile of to ever be released watch dogs was good to me but pro skater 5 that looks like hell i ll say it over and over andromada is a good game that is vastly underrated by a lot of people yes and no the story was bland compared to the previous games in the series even more so however the combat was amazing it was fast paced played smooth and was very tense on the higher difficulties i replayed the game to play around with different abilities and weapons because i enjoyed the combat so much as for the story they did try some humor liam costa is the worst mass effect companion ever to me but his loyalty mission has some very good humor too bad one mission doesn t save a story andromeda is the worst mass effect game but falcon went a little overboard because a bad game in general it is not gameranx leaving out no mans sky like we wouldnt notice battlefront 2 was pretty terrible at launch i know this wouldn t make top 10 but kh3 was definitely a let down imo where was cod black ops 4 imo fable 3 should get out of the list every game should move down the list once other than top 2 games and add no man s lie to the list yes the game is a great game now but it was a big disappointing game at launch no man s sky watched until god of war was the example for games that lived up to the hype i knew fable was gonna be on this list me if i were a game that bug at 0 07 that shit happen to anyone else with snipers in warzone anthem was the biggest let down for me firefall my god in the closed open beta 2012 2014 it was the best game ive played in years so much potential then a chinese company bought them and they threw out everything that made it fun installed progression walls and tried turning it into a pvp pve mmo wow shooter and it sucked watch dogs is amazing better that the 2nd hell the 2nd is ridiculous no evangelos paps nah lol true amen nah the second one is better but the first game had a better story because he s black the first was definitely better chris dunn dj wooow where is that came from where s no man s sky im worried cyberpunk ends up on one of these lists why are you worried cdpr have got it in the bag the immersion will be impressive i believe and its not rushed like many others i m starting to think that all your videos are the same but with different titles maybe you should take a day off instead of uploading every day watchdogs was great i dont know what you bastards where expecting i disagree to put andromeda as number 1 is silly it was way better than duke and colonial marines just downloaded watch dog it s free for limited time pc or console still better than its sequel watch dogs 2 was written and done by hipsters for hipsters no game is ever as good as it was hyped to be because theirs going to always be some that like something and some who dont like something about a game damn watchdogs ain t even that bad but watch dogs 2 thooo the reason the graphics in watch dogs got downgraded is because of consoles they didn t want to treat anyone differently hi you forgot doom eternal game s bloated and irritating by how wrong it has done everything i liked about 2016 doom you are in the minority doom eternal took doom 2016 and merged it with classic doom you re an idiot if you think it was overhyped or bad did you really leave out the biggest overhyped game of all time aka no man s sky besides that i 100 agree also disappointed in andromeda s multiplayer more than anything watch the beginning of the video at 0 25 speed thank me later xd so wheres rdr2 online fable 3 was good that game was absolutely awful and a major step down from 2 4 hour long story which was horrendous combat was dumbed down even more bland environments and should of been a expansion pack it was the no man s sky of it s era except it never got better how is watch dogs dissapointing they did not downgrade anything gameplay wise the people who hate it just because the graphics aren t next next gen aren t true gamers it s funny i ve only owned 1 of theses guys anthem hurt me the worst star citizen lol what s up with that game it s been in testing for almost 10 years if it ever comes out to the public it will probably look old and obsolete now that game had a lot of hype too it s still not out yet right saw a comment on a sc vid trying to say after 9 years that the game was still in very early development that s a special sort of stupid any legitimate complaint about 76 could be made about fallout 4 bugs etc if you like 4 and don t like 76 you re objectively wrong thank god i played andromeda 2y after releasing its was a decent game and yes i will never call it mass effect spin off andromeda i can chew that i played the game a while ago to it ain t so bad as people say it is they must have improved it overtime with updates or something it would do a lot better if ea would just call it andromeda a mass effect world game i bet you people would just buy it as a concept and not think too much about the connection yeah i got it at walmart for 5 it was pretty good for 5 but if i payed 60 i d probably be a little annoyed as a playstation fan i say this with a heavy heart but no man sky should be at the top of the list even if they have fixed this the division should be on this list thought battle front ii would be on this michael jr cortes no everybody new battlefront 2 was going to be bad because of ea agreed with all of them especially duke 3d man i waited years to play a sequel to duke 3d but nope anthem should have also been an offline game so i am the only one that enjoyed mass effect andromeda earth fall was a horrible game it s a left4dead rip off the aliens are the special infected from left4dead reskined pretty much just very very sad and disappointing ben gall why brndon lu why not mark hit em up why knot avicul o why nott make out hill y naught played it and i thought it was fun tactical sloth78 that s because they re just ripping off l4d yeah i was bored after a few hours and didn t go back but that s probably my fault playing offline tactical sloth78 i liked it too in my opinion hamster chief why naut i love fable 3 some of my favorite side quests of all time and just an overall fun experience in fact i would replace fable 3 with yooka laylee as we sort of figured molyneux s schemes by that point i think that s why it was so high on the list i liked 3 myself can you do 10 games that surpassed their hype i haven t fully watched all of it yet im at watchdogs please oh please let anthem be on this list lok what s up with all the lies anyway it doesn t pay out at the end people will call you out and you gonna have a bad reputation just be honest about what you got on the table you left out jump force okay buddy but were the frigity frigin is crackdown 3 it sucked and it s the reason i bought an xbox and the game is garbage compared to what it showed worst one i actually bought was fallout 76 bitterly disappointed watchdogs was a fantastic game the issue wasn t with the game it was that the hype train got out of control i still revisit it and enjoy the experience ubisoft over promised and overhyped it but that doesn t mean the game was a disappointment for the time it was excellent it was just not what was promised sonic forces being a sonic fan is difficult sometimes watch dog was a great game but when you look at the trailers it isn t what they said though playing through it is a decent game but the second kinda kept some and threw a lot out the window so i will stick with the first one anyday agreed the game might have sold better if they kept the e3 graphics settings for pc people have found it in the files or just have a honest game play trailer honestly i really liked watch dogs both game was fun for me so much when your in a fight in a dark like just like the fox totally agree didn t like the second one awful mess half life alyx its a good game but its not the vr milestone that boneworks was not even close the memes used here were in development since 2014 bioware bethesda bioware evolve had major hype and ended up being absolutely trash yeah it was so bad even f2p didn t save it surprised it didn t make the list i ll be honest i found it quite fun and it s what got me into asymmetrical games devon they took to long to make it f2p like 3 4 years after it came out so the damage was already done and over with no saving that game extendo q very true evolve was my favorite multiplayer game never played the f2p version why it trash ben fenwick bro i was god at evolve i m sad it died evolve wasn t that bad the studio just gave up this is coming from someone who spent probably too much time in it evolve was hella fun lmao couldn t have said it better myself i actually really liked evolve it was hella fun with friends im sad it died i thought it was good it was fun to play with others but it had a lot of flaws evolve introduced a cool concept but as most often it failed at it s execution i thought it was kinda good but what do i know thealmightyva605 and now you can t even play it because the servers are closed evolve was almost great imo very fun to play with friends the problem was that every time the team fixed one aspect of the game they would break several more so it just got to the point where it was unplayable by the time they got it right it was too late i thought evolve was fun for a short amount of time then it got real boring thealmightyva605 ign gave it a 9 10 don t ever forget that guys only game i pre ordered in my life as the beta was so much fun game came out day 1 with 250 of dlc including op monsters just for you to cash in plain disgusting come on yah all the micro transactions were str8 disrespectful i think you re wrong about a lot of those games especially fallout just because you don t like it don t make it a bad game it s come far in the time it s been out that and anthem f76 biggest dumpster fire in the history of gaming real shame some folks love crap games but each to their own you did this video allready star fox zero oh my heavy heart anthem was the biggest disappointment for me personally i remember them clearly stating that they would learn from the other competitors in the genre and as a wf player that got me on a hype bullet train only to get that thing idk honestly i skipped on buying the original game but now that they announced the revive maybe but yeaaah idk everytime i hear anthem i remember the developers saying the game will sell 2 millions copies in the first 2 3 months battlefront not being number 1 really surprised me i mean ik evolve wasn t that big of a hyped game but that was also kind of a train wreck y all remember jump force yeah worst purchase of my life who what crackdown 3 i liked anthem for still loading 5 20 that s one of my favorite game ever watchdogs was good idk why it gets so much hate did you really just compare duke nukem to halo because duke nukem has duel wielding lmao marathon had duel wielding i like first watch dogs because it reminds me of persons of intrest sandbox game ffxiii ffxv why s e ffxiv eventually became a good game but still like i agreen with most of these games being way way too hype but like some i dont necessarly agree with for an example andromeda i played never beat it but i enjoyed it and the whole fallout 76 i can agree because i feel like this was the first bethesda game that they made multiplayer assassins creed odyssey what about no mans sky watch dogs was my go to game on ps3 kh3 deserves to be in this list mass effect andromeda had some fun combat but the rest of the game was no where near the quality of the original trilogy i m confused was no mans sky not released within the last 10 years that game has been heavily improved to the point where its pretty much a completely different game i don t think it counts non of the games on this list have been improved in anyway shape or form if you been up to date with it then you would know that it has improved massively it would probably end up on a gaming comeback list nobody when you step on a splinter i m not gona buy this game bruh what s disappointing is that yall put your vids on ads andromedas lore was the only reason i finished the game when the best part about your action adventure game is the reading you know you done goofed i think the combat in the game is a lot better than the other mass effect games as well as the vehicles revealing storm yeah combat was real fun but they butchered it with bugs and a stupid storyline honestly i found it hard to like the lore itself and i loved mass effect s lore like yeah the tech is cool and all but that s it maybe it s just because the andromeda initiative seemed to be filled with idiots who had no idea what they were even doing more often than not and the angara and kett feeling particularly dull revealing storm the combat was great although they dumbed down the squad commands loved the return of planetary exploration too david barnett one thing this guy got wrong the andromeda crew and the rest left their worlds 600 years before the first mass effect game after the first contact war and just when aliens became friendly proof is if you get all the memory things you get to hear the invasion happening and when you try to use the radio that connects to earth all you get is static it uses sub space communication so they arrived just as the third game started well the end and the combat was pretty good the story wasnt that bad the characters meeeeeh i forgot about them quickly i was disappointed by some big titles like far cry 4 uncharted 4 rdr2 dark souls 3 pillars 2 and lately doom eternal some of them are mediocre generic games some of them are not even bad but i expected way more or something entirely different readyaimfire rdr2 what howww that game got a amazing story and amazing graphics and more astrobot i guess i was expecting something faster with more action like gta in wild west setting what i got was cowboy simulator slow game with thousands of boring slow mechanics readyaimfire did you never play the first game no man s sky i loved me andromeda how is warcraft 3 reforged not in 1st place no man s sky at launch was nowhere close to how much they and sony fanboys hyped it lol add to that everyone said it was exclusive but it went to xbox lol i didn t see no mans sky on this list we were blatantly lied to about what to expect sure it s great now but day one no man s sky was a flat out lie of a game street fighter v should have been an honorable mention too i thought watch dogs was okay just too much hype around it graphics meh whatever who doesn t downgrade from e3 trailers anyways it feels like you guys are just renaming videos and posting them again if i don t see skate 3 i m gonna be pissed update i did not i am pissed i enjoyed mass effect andromeda same same but i can t really sit here and say its anywhere near the same quality it should have been if it was a standalone scifi game it would have been fine but as something that was supposed to kickstart a new me series yeah disappointing co op was going to be in fallout 4 but was scrapped ya forgot 76 made more mistakes than that 60 wasnt all people spent some spent a couple hundred for the version with a supposedly canvas survival bag and a toxic helmet that got recalled and let s not forget that when todd howard said 16 times the detail i think he meant 1 16 of the detail where s wolcen lords of mayhem which we were lied too alpha was better wheres warcraft 3 too everything in it was bad number 0 final fantasy 15 i remember playing fable 2 i used to beat my meat to the sound of my character banging his wife they will make a great elderscrolls and back on track with that engine for next gen yep feel it commin fable 3 wasn t a good game tho mass effect andromeda ruined my memories of the trilogy i love so much i hope we can get another mass effect that isnt like andromeda everyone hates on aliens but honestly with all it s flaws it was still a fun game to play with friends anthem and fallout 76 fighting for first spot watch dogs is a great game i would literally sell my left kidney for a new fable game i have played fable 1 2 and 3 countless times absolutely love the series we do not talk about legends anthem was a horrible disappointment and to anyone reading this they canceled updates closed the road map the game is broken do not buy it it is a lost cause i knew that it was going to suck the moment i saw the that trailer same with fallout 76 fallout in terms of the map was good and the side quests we re good but the main story and everything else sucked fallout was barely good so fallout 76 was destined to fail oh did they finally give up and let it die like how they gave up on andromeda i thought the trailer was badass but man i just didn t have high hopes for it top 2 i 100 agree with for me assassin creed really turned to shit down the yesrs stfu watchdogs is good if youre not expect what ubisoft promised why do people pretend like they were hyped for anthem like we all know you weren t they bought into the concept trailer at e3 despite it being essentially fake i actually enjoyed andromeda it definitely could have been better though furthermore i learned a valuable lesson from this game never preorder anything ever wait for the reviews and then decide don t be like me spent 90 plus on the deluxe edition let me clarifying that watch dogs got mods so at the start was bad then now it good with mods and effects no man s sky yeah it is fantastic as a game now but at the release where s battlefront ii it s amazing now it s videos like this that remind me why i feel like roundhouse kicking people in the jaw whenever they feel clever caterwauling miyamoto s now infamous quote no you dumb bunnies not every game that is delayed is eventually good you re wrong go stand in the corner watchdogs story is pretty lit yea i loved that game got is still an open wound sees mass effect andromeda why did you have to remind all of us i was so hyped talking redemption for the ending in 3 and then it was worse than the first mass effect i was crushed but i did enjoy reading about the other people in the galaxy meh i think mass effect andromeda was good i like the story if you re like me and played watchdogs recently without knowing anything about it it s a really good game it s terrible kid now shut up and eat ice cream bro i didn t watch the trailer and i didn t know anything about it and it was one of my favorite games it s so fucking good such an amazing game that was ruined by a sequel trying to be like gta tribal media it s not even terrible cmon man really good it was okay dude gameplay is piss poor kakugen hey opinions i liked the gameplay it was simple to understand and plus the executions were badass but it s not the same for everyone hell i hate gta 5 i found it too unfun because i can t murder thousands of cops unlike in saints row 2 or 3 it was one of the most mediocre games i ve ever played not a fan and i didn t even watch the fake trailers i wouldn t say really good decent sure but it d be like a 6 10 fun but flawed the actually good one would be wd2 and even that s like a 1 point upgrade kakugen i thought it was good at first back when i was a little younger tribal media lmao let me guess you never played the game but saw the graphics downgrade so you call it bad nice kakugen idk what your talking about since the stealth mechanics and combat was pretty good it worked well with the hacking mechanics top giving good gameplay its just sad when there s a great concept for a game and it get ruined for some reason thankfully there s a lot of games to choose from fr if destiny became what it was supposed to be it would be revolutionary launch version of no man s sky needed a mention sure it s pretty much fixed now but what we got from the mega hyped release version was a barebones survival game where you just kept doing the exact same thing again and again with little payoff and a ton of missing features how is no man s sky not on this list control was a let down for me ea sucks boy this list is a real blast form the past good times when a 70 year old does 69 there s only 1 left get lost fallout 76 i admit wasn t good the only thing good about it was the graphics and the base building half life 3 is in here i actually preferred the first watch dogs over the second one i do to the second one had more but oddly less yesssss i agreee i don t know why everybody prefers the second same here never like that entire yoo broo wassup kind of attitude and story of the sequel i love the first game the feeling of being a vigilante i kinda felt like batman with a gun 1st one was ok but still a big let down didn t even bother with the 2nd one and legion actually looks good but i still have my doubts lol me too i love both watch dogs they are two of my top 10 games i thought i did too and there s definetly things i prefer in watchdogs 1 but after replaying both of them i really prefer watch dogs 2 matt larsen the second one was almost cartoonish and felt like it was made for 10 year olds who may have tought it was awesome to play as adult teens around the city the first one seemed more serious same kei synester if you ve only played like 12 games i guess that s possible good and evil because there s alot more you can do in wd2 than wd1 like customize your character however you like different paint jobs for your cars or weapons and the drone and rc xd they also did away with the the things you need to do like for example the blackout hack you need to have certain parts to make the thing i dont remember if it had explosives and emp s you had to find parts for to craft and then use in wd2 they did away with that and the explosives and emp s have a coop down and you start off with two then upgrade it enough to have a maximum of five and you dont need to find parts to use your hacks like blackout you just upgrade it and now you can use it you just have a cool down til you can use it again thats alot better it just has things you can have fun with and things they did away with for wd2 wd1 definitely had a better story and i got attached to the characters but in wd2 you can do more i would pick wd1 over wd2 any day i wouldn t say i dislike wd1 but it did feel lackluster a lot of it is due to very barebones characters but even then there was a fair bit of dull gameplay won t say wd2 is great by any means its characters aren t all that either but they felt more entertaining than most everyone in wd1 gameplay also felt a lot more polished there were things that were better in the first game though like the cyber trips and the skill system at least the first one didn t have a group of hipsters as the main characters i liked anthem untill the story ended dj hunt z think it s comeback will work i liked the credits personaly best part of the game for me logan lopez if no mans sky could do it maybe it s not really bioware s foult for being forced to make multiplayer games while they have no experience with them sans the skeleton it might not have been their fault for it being mp or the most of the lies leading up to its release however it is their fault for screwing around and not really making the game until they had only 18 months left a rather similar story to colonial marines which is also on the list i m with you there it had its moments for sure as stated the flying was cool the suits were cool but once you beat the story it was just now what and at least on ps4 dont get me started with the amount of times it bugged out or just straight up shut off my console i liked anthem until i heard it was online only theeman11910 don t get your hopes up this is ea we are talking about i thought it was decent but the ending ruined the game best part of the game was not buying it dj hunt z i think it had one of the worst final bosses ever insanely easy to complete and i even went on harder difficulties to see if the difficulty was the problem but nope still way too easy to beat and did not feel satisfying at all rosa park s dried and stretched out asshole i liked it but the worst was the online mass effect andromeda fits the definition of dissapointing for me overall i enjoyed it and saw a bit of what they were going for with that said it had so many issues and was a huge misstep in the franchise am i the only one that absolutely loves the first watch dogs i think it s a great game i still play it today and with the living city mod it s even better i wouldn t say fallout 76 was disappointing i never expected it to be that good agreed bethesda announcement we re going to release a multiplayer fallout without npcs me wtf that s going to be crap no interaction with npc s no thanks that s gona crash real bad could have told them at the concept stage stop talking about duke nukem everyone knows it was shit and it doesn t need to be restated so much watch dogs 1 was not that bad again more bad reporting or is it just bad researching in either case halo did not introduce dual wielding weapons in fps s they had dual wielding in goldeneye 007 i don t know why you think a basic feature was introduced so late 2001 as halo was released in that year halo 5 better be on here lmao watch dogs 1 didn t have as great graphics as the trailer but the game itself it really fun personally i like it more than 2 i really enjoyed mass effect andromeda as game that i could play like a break in long gaming sessions of other games gta v fallout 76 was not a co op game honestly i think bethesda tried making it to much like gta or an mmo how do you compare it to gta if you feel fable 3 is a good game you really should just stop playing games it s his opinion i m sure there s tons of people that think a game you like is shit where is no man s sky check out watch dogs with mods they re getting close to what e3 2012 showed i was waiting for mass effect to come up and i thought it wasn t included but at least you didn t disappoint me um no man sky watch dogs even before the thumbnail watchdogs is one of my favorite games i do see the graphics thing but the story is amazing you should play more games my friend p laguna a yeah i have watch dogs i beated it and after that i was like welp what now i came back played for 1 hour got bored i like watchdogs but i did try and play it again but couldn t the story is good and gameplay is ok but no replay value at least for me gameplay was shit yeah wd1s atmosphere and story was great the stealth and gameplay also made it really good its one of my personal favourite games too shame all people could do was complain about the graphics downgrade what about the borderlands pre sequel no man s sky no man sky anybody you forgot no mans skyyy no man sky wait the got rpg was in 2012 that looks exactly like a lord of the rings game from early mid 2000 s i used to be a die hard mass effect fan seeing the franchise die like that broke my heart same bro it didn t deserve the 1 spot tho it was an ok game 6 5 10 definitely not the worst same some of these aren t bad i dont get it watch dogs was one of the best games in history even now is still and amazing rpg with a great story and a badass protagonist the cops logic in watch dogs is fucking terrible worst horrible sry gameranx but i disagree watchdog is a good game i don t know why people hate them the game was awesome i really like it rdr2 is the most disappointing by far only good thing about it was how it looked but it failed miserably in every other aspect but why 10 years we already pass last gen why not from this gen i think anthem should be number one i was heartbroken after that aaa a is for anthem a is for also anthem a is for anthem again where the hell is no man s sky we are not a in a time for trolling you forgot ride to hell retribution where s mafia 3 the good game out of the way fable 3 was complete and total garbage okay where is no mans sky mate fable iii straight up sucked the worst 50 i ever spent it stopped me ever buying another game on day 1 geezus no more fluff just tell us falcon am i the only one here who actually loved andromeda dude i got it day one something i never did before then and will never again i booted it up and it was glitchy as shit the character i created looked nothing like the one i made in the creator the graphics looked super half assed nearly every character was boring and uninteresting the dialogue was fucking horrid the animations looked dated and like they were dumped from the original trilogy which makes no god damn sense because it was made in frostbite instead of unreal but the appearently still reused animations from 2007 in their 2017 game i was already bored of the game and its story and plot but when that kett reproduction plot twist or whatever the fuck it was happened i turned that bullshit the fuck off i get why people like this game but for me holy shit this was a tragedy no man s sky i mean sure it s gotten a lot better over the years but remember the sh tshow it was at launch wrong list it probably would be put in a gaming comeback list watch internet historians no woman s land video it provides a great explanation as to what happened with no man s sky and why it was so bad at launch but overall yes i agree i was surprised it didnt show in place of watch dogs tbh i think it deserves not to be on the list because of the amazing comeback they did no my friend that would be a big disrespect for the game and now i feel no man s sky is just a good game that everyone just trying to put their blame on if it s gotten better and you know that then this list is definitely wrong for it not mentioning all the hate he will get if he put it in the list since it got big community that loves their game i feel like even with the arguments about the gaming comeback thing that no man s sky could be on this list due to the very first disclaimer in the video the games on the list aren t necessarily bad just over hyped nms is kind of the poster child for over hyping no matter the current status all of the reasons people bring up of why it s a good game now doesn t change the fact that they lied about it being a open universe mmo at launch david barnett he did watch dogs dirty i fuckin loved it tomec i recall the hype for no mans sky being insane and then it utterly crashing and bombing until they eventually polished it up it definitely fits this list honestly watching it crash and burn was really entertaining but now that its good its even more satisfying i was thinking the same thing that game was such a let down and it took them a few updates to make it what we thought it was gonna be mrlaafish why it was one of the biggest disappointments on release it completely fits this list for the same reason fable 3 fits the list too much was promised 7 ever heard of sentence structure but jea i think i agree with you if i understand you correctly mrlaafish seriously this finally delivering a product as promised years after the fact is soooo amirable narrative is just annoying as hell how bout i take 20 from you promising a steak then bust out a mcdonald s patty to then finally come out with the actual promised steak 1hr later i m such a great person for making such a comeback right might be because the title includes the word big and i believe nms is an indie no man s sky wasn t really the dev s fault anyways playstation tried to make it a big aaa title when they were just an indie team trying something new if they hadn t gotten so much publicity it s launch fallout wouldn t have been so bad sean murray didn t help himself in any of those interviews either actually no nms is getting a lot better than it first came out so yeah it kinda did belong in the comeback list and certainly not this list a rough start with a redemption is a rare exception so it doesn t belong here lol nah it was great at launch and better now when i clicked on this vid i was expecting no mans sky and no words can describe the disappointment on my face when it wasn t on here more like no man s game why would sony put so much pressure on an indie developer that was never equipped to make a triple a title maybe it didnt make the list because the improvements and free updates have brought it to a state where it actually is a pretty great game now left behind actually yes kid dooby lmao it was a trash can at 1st shoulda been just before fallout 76 wow yeah i thought nms would be number 1 mrlaafish nah it makes this list dumb video making 101 at launch i still thought it looked decent and for a small time developer it was pretty good mrlaafish agreed warframe would be right next to it no mans sky ahhh anthem you could have been so much more kingdom hearts 3 definitely not the satisfying conclusion to the xenahort arc that we were sold no final fantasy xv i love this channel and all but i don t like it when they trash on the first watch dogs no mans sky watch dogs gets way too much hate it gets compared to gta5 unfairly and judged on ita comparison to the original demo not on its own merits on its own merits it s a pretty cool and atmospheric open world game no man s sky assassin s creed 3 was disappointing anthem shouldn t be there because nobody was expecting anything from the game replace it with destiny replace watch dogs with the division 2 replace 1 with no man s sky what the hell hwo is no man s sky not even on this list lucas jordan no mans sky got a bunch of updates and it s actually a decent game now hello watch dogs driving mechanics are horrendous 1 2 gta 5 driving is worse i miss good bioware games biggest complaint with fallout 76 is just in inability to pause the game a fallout game without being able to pause isn t much fun at all adam wareing and vats i knew the game would suck when i realized vats wouldn t slow time and it would pretty much just immobilize you to get attacked why do you keep saying gayem instead of game i haven t watched the video but i ll predict that fallout 76 or no man s sky will be 1 well i was close kh3 and ffxv for me man i just want skate 4 i played watchdogs like once and was done where is mafia 3 in good news insurgency sandstorm is free for 5 days on steam so play that instead of these shit games i feel this video has been done before with a few different entries it s gamerax what do you expect they tend to recycle ideas for videos don t get me wrong i enjoy their videos but sometimes they feel too repetitive i feel like everytime they redo it the same games shouldnt be allowed to be relisted ruben ibaven i mean there s so much stuff you can talk about until ideas run out their list videos are not that great anymore i only watch the friday show and the before you buys this is why nobody should do top tens anymore if i haven t seen watchdogs in about four of their other top ten lists its because they do disappointing games of month year this is top 10 of decade out of all the games in those lists i m waiting for anthem isn t destiny 2 also kinda bad the division launch maybe the art boxes of fable are cooler than the actual games not mentioning ghost recon breakpoint that hurt man narfu i player t beta and it seemed like the division gameplay but in ghost recon environment driving and flying about in the demo was painful for me the controls are clunky and really bad imo and a real big discredit to tom clancy him self as it really didn t feel like a gr game at all they lost all the charm of the originals pagoda construction site all the best maps from old graw and game play are missing in breakpoint why isn t halo 5 on this watch dogs 1 was a great game you just have some weird lighting setting there s nothing wrong with it really exactly i mean is one of the best games made i dont understand you serious bruh go watch the e3 demo and tell me they aren t different games they downgraded watch dogs because they didn t want to piss off sony and microsoft people have talked about this lol and also because the consoles would literally not be able to handle those types of graphics you still get pretty bad lag and framerates drops even in the downgraded version daniel a hold up are you saying watch dogs was too good jaquan murphy there are mods for the pc version where you can get the actual graphics that were in the trailer as was said in the video jargon madjin it wasnt even graphical downgrades they removed features that were seen at e3 fable 3 is not a good game at all lol no mans sky what about assassin s creed unity angelo iz hea you mean odyssey unity was the last good one in my opinion tanner clark odyssey is an awesome game you really didn t enjoy it tanner clark unity good this buggy mess angelo iz hea you mean syndicated and odyssey tanner clark i love all of the assassins creed games most of them have flaws but all have redeeming qualities ac 1 revelations i haven t played in a while but remember them all being very solid especially 2 and brotherhood ac 3 had a story that wasn t always great but the unique weapons and setting were great ac black flag is incredible but has the slight problem of being a bit tooo much of a pirate game sometimes rogue suffered from feeling similar to black flag although the story was interesting unity is very strong customisation gameplay and graphics wise but was massively held back by the phenomenonal amount of bugs at release syndicate i personally loved although it did feel very much more of the same origins was a fantastic fresh take on the series with an incredible story however it was held back on being such a massive change in gameplay style and odyssey is amazing i m replaying it right now and am having a blast however it suffers from the same problem as origins in the sense that it is a massive departure from the series past the story is also not directly connected to the assassins but is more the world they inhabit and that s not for everyone peregrine hall i loved the humour having a chat with sokrates or taking the minatour guided tour or jump from a sync point and landing on my face or crashing into a tree cracked me up there was so much to do in a massive open world i would try and stay focused and thoroughly explore each region but would find myself zig zagging all over the place and just going with the flow and i m convinced that s how the game is best played circleofsorrow exactly plus there is a mission where you have to get viagra for an old woman and you just can t top that cough warcraft 3 reforged cough i like duke nukem forever covid 19 was a pretty bad game surprised you guys didn t include ac odyssey as an honorable mention minitebuhzed it was a great game just because ubisoft changed assassins creeds gameplay doesn t mean it s bad ksnow 42 the framerate ruins the entire experience a game this old should not stutter like that period it s inexcusable for ubisoft to leave a games performance in that state what place will evolve get how about every years madden bring back nfl2k instantly clicked and thought fallout 76 i was expecting that to be number one wow i m impressed you managed to get down to 10 disappointing games especially in this day and age yea they could definitely do a part 2 top 1 most dissapointing industries paleghost69 i mean over 10 years there s bound to be bad games amnesia a machine for pigs should be on here lol i think that watch dogs is a little bit underrated i played this game and i enjoyed it is it just me idk but still it s underrated and you shouldn t have high expectations for a new ip i know the demo was way different than the game but still the game delivers that s not the point the point is they promised one thing and literally showed what they promised then went very far back on it honestly it barely delivers the concept was really cool but there was absolutely no depth to the game it boiled down to generic ubisoft open world game all the sidequests points of interest and even main quests were very repetitive specially at the time it came out it just ended up feeling like a way worse gta v with a few gimmicks uh why shouldn t i have high expectations for a new ip by a well known aaa developer i know they have all the money and resources to make a great game i haven t watched the video but i bet destiny is on the list how abaut mafia 3 i hope batman arkham knight is on this list not sure if this is big but screw it the 1 is raid shadow legends yeah even if you had no expectations you would still be disappointed they put to much money in there sponsorships and not the actual game so yeah pretty accurate gold no one youtube and every website come play raid shadow legends start now for free how is no mans sky not on here because they changed it to its promising form it improved over the years coronavirus how could you miss halo 5 that trash game hyped locke vs master chief all the hunt the truth campaign and those podcasts promised to show how corrupt oni was and in the end we got a cinematic thats it that was probably the worst most hyped game ever maybe after watchdogs and 76 i feel bad for duke nukem his return was terrible and now gearbox and randy pitchford have him hostage and will never release a dn game ever again watch dogs was probably my favorite game of that list original idea good plot and gameplay sure the graphics was a big downgrade but it was overall alright wd2 was way better and i hope wd legion will do well because of the system of no direct main character i hope i can afford it when it comes out tbh the idea of not having a main protagonist is kind of a bummer the story may either end up suffering from this or be better because it s all up in the air wd2 was way better gameplay wise story wise we need aidan back good plot alastor your point daniel a its prolly gonna be one of those games with multiple endings and stories just like nier automata im om with that but im sticking with wd2 it just has more freedom for me wdl will do away with some things from the previous game that i like it is cool you can be anyone and have certain perks depending on their occupation if you hire an boxer to join dedsec youll have more endurance to survive more longer before you die cuz well a boxer trains at cardio breathing running etc its a cool concept and i may get it kei synester play better games man kakugen i ve noticed how all you ve done is reply to any comments about watch dogs and just cry about it being bad or how people need to play other games just because your too ignorant to see that it s a good game that many people enjoyed it doesn t mean you have to hate on them where s no man sky i didn t go back to the game like other beta gamers after they shafted everyone you should it changed a lot it s amazing now compared to launch no man sky is a great game agreed no man s sky is trash just because they updated the game doesn t change the fact that people were lied to about what the game would do at launch it s shameful using the word beta wow so much masculinity very manly you mean wordt games of the last decade i will never understand the hate towards watch dogs it s a great game huntermonster25 it s bugged badly i was 3 4ths my way through it and all my weapons disappeared on my save after doing online once lost all my weeks of completionist work it s a fun game but that bug forced me to give it a 2 10 i will never understand people who hype up a game only to set themselves up for disappointment facts it s one of the only games i ve played more than twice one my 6th playthrough right now too many people thought the e3 version was the final version that was before people understood not to trust e3 footage i m looking at you crackdown 3 it s boring af but it s not hard to understand the demo watch dogs looked fucking amazing but the released one is basically a modded gta iv which released at 2008 o o plus its still run like shit although i love this game too but its obvious why people hate it well it was still a disappointment that didn t live up to expectations because ubisoft lied man fable 3 was the first fable game i played and i loved it but always heard the 1st two were better now i know why it was the first fable game i played too and it sucked ass i was literally playing watch dogs right before this was uploaded lol dude same replaying it for the 2nd time if you enjoy it why not lmao samee i liked it when i played it but i had a hard time replaying after i tried to relive the experience i hope to come back around one day story is good once at least great game someonenamedaaron just finished platinuming it now after replaying it for the 5th time guess u could say im a pretty big fan history of aaa gaming in 1 video i thought watchdogs was pretty good although not one of my favorite games it had some pretty good stuff in it that was later utilised better in wd2 but the visual downgrade hit it really hard for a lot of people lwaves the visual downgrade was only for pc tho and even then it has to be said that the extent of the downgrade is something that s regularly seen from ubisoft thankfully they learned their lesson from the backlash but i maintain that pc users especially were very much the catalyst for the runaway hype train they saw everything that was promised and shown and never took it with a pinch of salt it was only ever going to lead to dissapointment for the time the game was an excellent experience which i personally revisit once every few months or so this video does have a disclaimer saying they re not necessarily bad wd isn t that good but it s not bad it certainly was a disappointment at release asa abbott wrench was amazing though i learned about wd1 after its release and became interested in what the game became rather than what it was promising to be for me that s always been enough and i ve beaten the original game at least 3 times now while marcus from wd2 has a cool move set especially with the drone it ll never compare to that kinetic feeling you get with aiden sneaking up to enemies and taking them down in wd1 just feels so much more satisfying than in wd2 i also really liked the whole reputation system hearing about the vigilante on the news everything about wd1 really makes you feel like an absolute beast who cares about graphics anyways if gran turismo 5 is not on this list hey your my favorite youtube channel watch dogs is completely wrong the files that are left in files are nowhere like the demos there s no shaders left or anything all there is are lighting presets named e3 but as far as they go are the 2013 demo videos which were already downgraded saying all of it is there is completely wrong everyone keeps saying this since ages and it made ubisoft s reputation way worse just because someone seen a file named e3 which literally points to null the wd video shown in this video has nothing to do with this either it s a mod made by one person combined with more mods if cyberpunk 2077 god forbid ended up being mediocre or even terrible it would be the biggest disappointment in video game history se7enx89x i feel like it won t be bad but the expectations are way too high most games with that much hype tend to be underwhelming ugh how can you remind me of fable 3 adrian valenzuela sane fable 1 was the first rpg i ever played and fable 2 is still one of my favorite games of all time wish they could make up for 3 i actually really liked watch dogs it s one of my favourite games same i preferred it over watch dogs 2 lol watch dogs is awesome same i loved watch dogs 1 blank both were very good it was lame that was several years ago and i still feel ripped off i want my 60 back my wife enjoys it a bunch i can t handle the bugs same man your a simp why watch dogs ok i got it 69 comment no one me just give me like glad andromeda was on here that game ruined my taste with regards to mass effect absolute garbage agreed hated almost everything about it the story characters missions even the combat i much prefer me2 and 3 combat they felt much more tactical and cover was very important if 2k18 isn t on here ima die u r l e e i liked the got rpg tbh the story was p much the only good thing tho oh boy why m i smelling no man s sky nope biggest comeback in games so no definitely no man s sky was absolutely horrible i don t care what people say the fact it was such a let down at launch and developer lied about almost everything the game could do not played it since the first few weeks of it no man s sky might go down in history as the one of the best games with an unplayable launch watch internet historians video on nms trust me you ll rethink your opinion after best comeback your nose id deceiving you my friend first captain borealis i ve seen it while i applaud their effort to fix the game and understand that they suffer a series of mishap but they should ve been honest to the mass the game is an ambitiously huge they re a small studio and the timeline is inadequate they fix the game not just because their sense of responsibility but also because their reputation depends on it ubisoft games are aweful stop buying them uh no they are bunch of copypastes this is why they are bad agree noti squad yessir mafia 3 iasonas strike i haven t seen it all the way through yet but mafia 3 deserves to be on here imo cause it s predecessor was just so much better 40 first comment lol who else hates mrbeast bots who like it if you can 58 seconds yah it s 4 here was about to sleep after binge watching your videos and now received a notification for this one alright then one more akash bhullar ok akash bhullar ok akash bhullar ok akash bhullar ok what about fifa they re releasing the exact same game every single year uh and 2k and madden are also same game every year no one expects anything from them so no one was disappointed same with cod games but dumb folk still buy it i mean tbf it s a sports game and you can t really change anything with those types of games cause the sport itself never changes although we could use another fifa nba nfl street my worst games bought 1 fallout 76 2 black ops 4 3 battlefield 1 and 5 4 farcry 5 newdawn battlefield 1 isn t bad why new dawn that game was great astrobot you basically just buy far cry 5 again but it s more overgrown it s basically a dlc they sold as a game you should have waited for the sake for far cry 5 new dawn i thought battlefield 1 was great fam hi mr beast mrbeast isent here thats just a fake copycat if u look on there channel they made a playlist of all his vids to trick u go to his real upload section and youll see people say jump force was a disappointment but i personally love the matches anime guy jotaro awesome video you deserve more views i swear to god if a rockstar game is on here i m going crazy edit let s go a rockstar game is not on this list it s no surprise though watchdogs was an amazing game that s the fucking truth everyone is here for fallout 76 notification gang here im so glad you didn t put deaths stranding on here even though it deserved it noah murrells it sounds pretty mind numbing to be honest def a dis honorable mention tho walking simulator it should be on here you are the best bro you should have more then 10m subscriber watch dogs legion disappointed me i prefer gta that hasn t even come out yet mushy pasta he s apparently from the future yooooo send me the copy you shouldn t compare the two franchises each franchise presents a different concept and each one has it s highs lows and the main characters are way different and their motives are different basically any ubisoft and bethesda game released recently james jennings especially ghost recon breakpoint wd2 was alright and wd legion looks good but breakpoint and 76 was trash so yes on god assassin s creed fans be like bro that s just harsh mass effect andromeda hold my cd first ah got you don t get mad plz i luv u all 22nd i think halo 5 was one of them my most disappointing game was kingdom hearts 3 final fantasy xv and no man s sky are up there too elijah gray why kh3 i was blown away personally did you play all the others before 3 that s weird ffxv is one of my favorite game ever no mans sky took a while but is fantastic now ffxv is only good if you add the extra 40 content expansions through movies and all dlc etc kh3 wasnt bad per se just not worth the hype and long wait by no man s sky do you mean at launch or now thecommentsuperhero it was good but massively downgraded look at the 2013 e3 trailer amd compare it way different look and atmosphere and the gameplay looks way better agreed i don t play final fantasy games but i do enjoy kingdom hearts kh3 was an absolute shot to the heart with how bad it was and no man s sky is an even bigger oof this channelis so good breakpoint on here nobody is hyped for ubisoft games nowadays i knew it was gonna be shit when i played the beta it was too broken boring buggy bland ugly near launch date strayfu that s not true lmao look at watch dogs legion gods monsters skull bones and beyond good evil 2 there s hype who else thinks alien colonial marines is on here that game was a shame gearbox will never get my trust back mrblackspoon what about borderlands no i feel there are more deserving of 10 spots i ll see in a moment though edit yep it s here 3 1 view 43 likes poop hi cool vid 3 probably not third nvm
