 april s gonna be a big month for videogames hi folks its falcon and today on game ranks games you need to play in april of 2020 just a quick disclaimer before we get started minecraft dungeons is almost definitely delayed there s no real reason to expect that game this month so that s why we re not talking about it but without further ado number 10 is deliver us to the moon a sci fi thriller set in a post apocalyptic future with there s no energy source on the earth that works anymore anyways but one was found on the moon now a base was set up to harvest this energy and something happened where all communications from that base ceased you are an astronaut going up to investigate what happened this is a game that came out on pc last october it is very well loved by the community of people who ve played it it s not a terribly long game i beat it in just a little over six hours and it s one of those games it ll just suck you in entirely it s such a good telling of a story and while being extremely well told the story is also refreshingly simple in a manner that makes it a lot more believable deliver us to the moon is hitting ps4 and xbox one on april 24th and at number nine is disaster report for summer memories a fairly novel concept where you have to escape a city that has been destroyed you play as a character that goes into the city for a job interview there s a massive earthquake and you re trapped it s cool you can enter collapse buildings and try to find new ways to get out as you re doing this you ll find other survivors and you can use psvr with this thing i ll say it s interesting in these times that we re seeing games like this developed it s obviously a series that has become gradually more noticeable disaster report 4 summer memories is coming to playstation 4 nintendo switch and pc on april 7th and number 8 is snow runner a trucking game we re going through very cold extreme environments with a pretty deep simulation on environments the physics that we ve seen and that have been explained about this game sound incredible they ve done a great job simulating different water levels for the environment so you may end up having muddy terrain you may end up having frozen terrain and your truck will react different no matter what kind of terrain that is what s particularly cool is of course when you have to cross water the water currents may actually overwhelm your truck and upturn it and from what i ve seen it s actually kind of cool when that happens the physics stuff of this game is really impressive and i m definitely looking forward to how it plays out there s a wide range of different trucks you can be driving from small pickup trucks to massive semi trucks there s a ton of heavy industrial equipment you could be driving it looks like a pretty in depth trucking simulation it sounds like a lot of fun snow runner is releasing on the 28th on ps4 xbox one and pc at number seven is gears tactics a turn based strategy game of course based on the gears of war franchise honestly i think that s a good idea just right off the bat something along the lines of xcom but as gears of war you rarely up a squad and go through a immersive and character driven story according to the marketing materials one thing i definitely do like is that it promises to bring some very big boss battles the game has actually set 12 years before the original gears of war close to the beginning of the actual war where cities are falling to the locust horde obviously stuff gets worse after the events of this game so i think we can make some guesses as to what exactly happens however it s bound to be quite a ride gears tactics has come in xbox one and microsoft windows april 28th at number 6 is some day you ll return a psychological horror game that looks like it s very much drawing on sort of outlast and vanishing of ethan carter as well as the more traditional silent hill sort of you re entering a mystical place type thing the idea of this game is you re looking for your daughter she s run away a few times before but this time it feels different because she has run away to a forest that you promised you would never return to of course you return to it hence the title today is some day so to speak and the game presents you with a very unique and otherworldly forest that s filled with lots of well let s just say terrifying stuff there s monsters in this game but let s be honest the human foes are probably the worst at least according to what we ve seen so far someday you ll return is coming to playstation 4 xbox one and windows on april 14th at number 5 is predator hunting grounds which is an asymmetrical shooter that yes we ve seen quite a few of those in recent years but in all honesty pretty much everything we ve seen and heard about this one sets it apart in a way of that makes me a little more excited for it predator is a hell of a monster to be able to play as and from what we ve seen of the gameplay it looks like they ve adapted it really well basically having a single meter that handles everything giving him the ability to do a lot of stuff but balance it in a way that it s not completely unfair and believe me like in the movies it s really unfair the predator is an overpowered bad guy on the in part that s the lure of this game even obviously the point if you re not the predator is to get the hell out of the forest i mean you re not totally helpless against the predator but you re not gonna be killing it so don t bother with that you do have a nice range of some weapons from assault rifles to shotguns to more heavy weapons but let me just say this in truth all the jumping between the trees though really makes playing as the predator appealing to me it looks like a lot of fun there s a lot of different weapons that the predator specifically has access to which seem like a lot of fun and predator hunting grounds is hitting ps4 april 24th at number 4 is soccer wars a soft reboot of the longtime series the game of course takes place in 8 obviously fictionalized version of 1940s japan and combines elements of dating sims visual novels and action role playing meaning there s a ton of dialogue and on top of that there s combat honestly it looks like a game that s got a lot of depth the series itself is definitely what you would expect from something that combines a lot of different things it can be a little all over the place i ve played previous titles before although keep in mind i played it way back in the day when it was a tactical role playing game and you had to run it on an emulator because you could not get it in the united states that being said ensuing titles came out here in the states it s always been a good series i kind of think that this is going to be a sort of modernisation of it and i think that that s not a bad thing i think that it s something that could use that it s believe it or not built on the hedgehog engine and is hitting playstation 4 on april 28 and number three is trials of mana a port of the game that originally came out in 1995 it s of course a full blown remake it s 3d it does have a very cool very old school jrpg type aesthetic to it although it does a really great job of bringing a more hand drawn look to 3d characters it doesn t go fully into it it s of course a game that has a slightly more action oriented battle system than a lot of jrpgs did at the time and that looks to be adapted in a way that i think actually builds on it pretty well obviously we ll have to play it but i certainly look forward to doing so when trials of mana hits on april 28th at number 2 is resident evil 3 this is of course a big daddy release resident evil 3 is one of the most phenomenal games ever made and i m incredibly looking forward to this remake of it it has been given the treatment of the resident evil 2 remake which resident evil 3 is kind of an extension of resident evil 2 given that some takes place directly before some takes place after and i m just really ready to see this resin evil 1 2 3 are my favorite of the resident evil titles and in truth i kind of have some hope that they do the same treatment with the original resident evil even though there is an hd remake of it because the resident evil 2 remake just absolutely kills and i fully expect this one to do it as well resident evil 3 is hitting pc ps4 and xbox one on april 3rd and finally at number 1 oh yes it s final fantasy 7 remake which oh this is gonna be good any doubts i had about this game we re just gone the minute i got into this demo this demo was absolutely phenomenal the kind of banter and between player back and forth just goes incredibly well with the tone of the game as well as the overall engine style of play level design boss design enemy design etc we know that this is going to be just mid gir and that it s going to be a very long game and they ve expanded a lot of midgar but i have to say i m quite excited because that means we re gonna be seeing a very large amount of final fantasy 7 over the next long while i have to imagine they have also been working on other areas of the game having more final fantasy 7 remake installments on the way we don t know anything about that yet but i m super stoked for this one it s hitting the playstation 4 on april 10 quick bonus title for you he ll point on action rpg that takes place on a space station filled with monsters and horrible things it might sound a bit like dead space but it doesn t look like dead space it actually looks a lot more like dark souls to me albeit in a much different environment that i think might actually be a pretty cool change the game offers local and online co op it looks like a hell of a fun time no pun intended he ll point is coming april 16th give it a look hyper parasite a game based on a type of organism that is a parasite of a parasite intriguing yes hyper parasite is however a twin stick shooter brawler where you control a body snatching parasite whose goal is to destroy humanity like let s just be serious that s a great concept for a game and it s currently out on early access of course on steam it s only 17 99 and well it s fun as hell i would highly recommend checking it out that s coming to pc ps4 xbox and switch in full on april 3rd it s not like you can t play it right now if you don t want
