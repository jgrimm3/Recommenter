 tons of games are released that are hyped beyond belief some of them live up to it but some don t hi folks its falcon ax today on game ranks the ten most disappointing big games of the last ten years just a quick disclaimer these games aren t necessarily bad some of them definitely are but others are good games that just are definitely not what they were hyped to be you ll be able to tell the difference pretty quick but we just wanted to say that off the top starting off at number 10 fable 3 if anything this is actually the reason for that disclaimer fable 3 is for all intents and purposes a really good game it s just definitely not what they said it was going to be really any of the fable games kind of follow the pattern of peter molyneux really hyping the hell out of it and then it just kind of being a basic rpg now for me these are like really good basic rpgs but they re not super innovative they re charming they re very funny their visuals are extremely appealing the third time around the story is kind of predictable but you know whatever you know basically what you re getting with the fable game by the third fable and you got it and that s not necessarily bad it s just every time it was supposed to be a revolution and although the game got better it was still kind of the same game three times and trust me when i say i enjoyed it and i would probably play the game a fourth time if they made the scenario just different enough i mean the first time around yeah cool good bad choices third time around yeah i kind of just in there for the charm again there s a lot of the charm but it was disappointed and moving on to number nine it s i am the duke i am a number one now that we got the good game out of the way that just wasn t what it was promised to be let s talk about do new go forever duke nukem forever was in development hell for a very long time duke nukem 3d was a tremendously successful game and in all honesty it brought a lot of cool improvements to the first person shooter genre as a whole so in 1997 they started making the sequel and when you play that game in 2011 oh you can tell that they started working on it in 1997 is it the biggest train wreck of all time no but it s a pretty big one like the humor let s just go ahead and say fits right in with the 1990s duke nukem 3d of course was a tremendous hit in 1996 it was very edgy it was at times very funny but duke nukem forever basically makes all the same jokes which is yeah i mean i rarely liked it with sequel movies that come out a few years from each other and the time between these games was significant it just didn t work adding to the fact that it was kind of just a basic halo type first person shooter which is also kind of weird considering duke nukem 3d was a doom like game also halo combat evolved was a decade old at the time duke nukem forever came out to basically rip that game off in a lot of respects including the two gun carrying it felt really dumbed down and it really wasn t polished especially for a game that had been in development that long and on it number eight the game of thrones rpg this game came out in 2012 and it doesn t look like a game from 2012 it s fairly cheap looking and here s the problem in all aspects but the story that s exactly what it is very cheap the plot was actually pretty all right it just doesn t stand up to any of its competition as far as mechanics or graphics or well anything but the story it s a parallel story to the first season of game of thrones and it was written in conjunction with george rr martin so it s kind of hard to be overly critical of the story it s good it s just it s not fun at all nor is it worth looking at in all honesty this could have been a book would have been a better thing which sucks because game of thrones at the time i mean this was long before the terrible last season way back when it was really good it was just begging for a nice deep rpg it did not get it though and number seven is aliens colonial marines let s just go ahead and say this title got lied about a lot over the six year alleged development cycle one of the big lies of course is the development cycle itself according to someone at time gate the company that actually made the game gearbox handed over a bunch of assets with no real rhyme or reason as to exactly how it all came together and over the course of nine months they made a game out of it yes a developer of the game on the team that actually made the game not the team that was hired to make the game but the team that that studio outsource the work to they said they were given a bunch of crap and told to make a game out of it in nine months so six year development cycle second biggest lie is the demo that they put out showing the game now it s customary to put out a demo that s not optimized to run on consumer pcs that s not abnormal however the game looked so much better in the demo than the game ever looked on anyone s pc actually playing and while the demo was not erect the actual game was a wreck in every possible way at number six speaking of downgrades let s talk about watchdogs the original probably one of the most notoriously downgraded games out there the original watchdogs does the stunningly bad thing of having a beautiful demo and having a very dull not demo i mean the amount of shaders and effects and general atmosphere it s literally just gone in the main game and over the years people have tried to prove that it s not actually downgraded it s just why their conditions and things like that but then amata figured out that all of that stuff all of the nice atmospheric effects all the explosions all the shaders it s all actually still in the game s files and they made a mod that reactivated them which is weird like why wasn t that stuff just available on the pc at least combine that with all the problems that the game has the pretty bad dialogue the artificial intelligence that you can t really call intelligent in any way the amount of invisible walls they definitely clean stuff up with the second game but hikes the first one is just not enough at number five is tony hawk s pro skater 5 oof remember when all we wanted was another tony hawk s pro skater game remember how good all the tony hawk s pro skater games are yeah it is with a heavy heart i bring up tony hawk s pro skater 5 which is aesthetically certainly a tony hawk game it s got tony hawk s name on it it s a skateboarding game the controls are vaguely similar i mean enough that it s identifiably supposed to be a tony hawk game but it s bad this was a game that came out on xbox one and ps4 and the graphics were i mean very playstation 2 like a lot of people actually called them inferior to the graphics on the original game which is not good probably my biggest gripe about this game is that the new stomp function was assigned to the grind button so you did both with the same button and the game couldn t tell which one you were trying to do when you re in the middle of a combo so you d be stomping a lot instead of grinding but i mean it s also bland and empty there s no npcs it s buggy i mean you could honestly go on for a very long time about the faults in tony hawk s pro skater 5 number 4 is mighty number 9 which is probably one of the bigger ones on this list honestly money number 9 was of course a kickstarter darling with keiji inafune a one of the original artists on the original megaman being the primary name behind the project he was the director as well obviously and all of us were really excited really happy to give money to the project making it happen we saw so much concept art we saw footage we saw stuff that made this look like the ultimate return to a mega man style that capcom unfortunately seemed unwilling to do at the time and wow the game is not good i mean if you re particularly interested go back a couple of years i was the one who did the before you buy on this one it s just i mean it doesn t feel like it goes with itself some bits of the game seem like they re sort of classic mega man ish some bits seem later some just don t seem consistent with mega man art style at all the levels are badly designed bosses are boring and repetitive there s pretty much no charm in any aspect of it it never makes you be like i like it and it s the kind of game that should do that frankly so when it doesn t it s just like what did i even buy this for it at number 3 is anthem oh anthem you looked so cool we loved your robot suits we loved your flying around some jungle sort of hybrid mashup planet the concept sounded so cool but there was that nagging live services little splinter that i d stepped on more than a couple of times at that point i mean in theory it basically delivers on the things it claims it will but it just i don t know it s not what it should be like even in terms of a loutre shooter with some sci fi elements it s just not there i mean there s not really much to it there s a lot of cool ideas but they never really get beyond that stage and don t get me wrong like there s aspects of it that are fun i do like flying around in anthem but you can t just do that that wouldn t be a game or enough of a game anyways and moving on to number 2 fallout 76 i feel like i could just like repeat the titles for about a minute straight now that we re up in these top tier disappointments and you just be like yep mmhmm yeah well at 76 wow basically everything you like about fallout it s not there i mean aesthetically it s there you re wearing a jumpsuit you come out of a vault in a lot of ways the environment is pretty cool there s not a lot of the fallout world that has vegetation so that was really neat that s about it a minute is not long enough to cover all of the flaws with fallout 76 but the best way to describe them is that fallout 4 is at least a quality game and while i may think that earlier entries in the series are better it retained everything that made people love fallout it had a story it had nbc s it had progression real progression and although yeah i guess co op would be cool and fallout 4 when you hear about fallout 76 you think well that could work except once you start playing it you realize no it can t it cannot work add that to all of the nonsense that they tried to fleece everybody with the merchandise the dlcs the premium a monthly subscription service in a game you paid 60 bucks for oh my god fallout 76 and finally number one mass effect andromeda now we ve all played the mass effect series right we all know it s a damn good series there is a case to be made against the ending of the game it was kind of fixed after the fact but it certainly wasn t enough to say the games were bad mass effect andromeda on the other hand is a game where you take off to find a new home for humanity in the middle of war where everybody needed to fight all hands on deck everybody there s a huge threat in the reapers yeah no we re gonna go colonize some other galaxy let s dedicate a ton of resources towards that a so you basically go steal some planets oh i m sorry cohabitate cohabitate on the planet oh and you know how it s a game that came out after mass effect all three mass effect games and generally games have better graphics when that happens you know you know what i m talking about yeah it didn t everybody s face in that game looked like a guy hit with a frying pan just before they walked on camera and everything about the game was bland and boring and it was really hard to get engaged with it in any way which sucks cuz honestly it could have been cool had they just done a better job but you know had to make anthem cuz that went so well what do you think leave us a
