sprouts this video reminds me very much of those puzzles lol i still have two of them the cheese bread and the watermelon pineapple there were many more feeling nostalgic great video i will never not be impressed by this channel no ysac thank you for existing eh you just recycled your content this is what happens when you prestige your chef skills 12 times could be a tik tok transition star what gordon ramsey doesn t want you to know we needed this this is what jesus does when cooking in the kitchen i will never not love your videos thank a little tribute to the hands a magician of frames and colors and games may bend time at will one and forty times as though each frame were a window into some illusory present that has once more been brought to life and each item can be fragmented pared down to its essence if one dares venture that far but what more can be done when cores are ground to dust when nothing is left to collapse imagination picking up where illusion erases its tracks when you are on lock down and have nothing to do still more useful than anything from 5 minute crafts m i love all your videos just one question how quarantine fundo on 3hundo i was hoping for a nobody likes you bit i love those why i like the recap are there two different voices does this guy do the voice for tina in bob s burgers you suck at cooking watching this makes me upset makes me wanna help

all these methods in your cook book asking for a friend you are actually amazing funny was needed thank you how dare you assume i exist thank you for existing local man arrested for the violent

nobody taking about the stupendous leek pun ripple chop that a jojo reference are we just going to ignore that amazing leek pun by the power of editing i don t know why but the asparagus spear gets me every time he s still got it i suck at cooking we laugh but at the end of the days we should realize the editing skills of this dude almost perfect 3 my head canon is that you suck at cooking is a

it thank you for existing ysac i love your work biblically correct carrot lol he didn t say i suck at cooking being stuck at home really unleashes your power if you look closely all of these tricks

yours before knives people used to just throw s t against the wall these words have made this man millions ok the last bit made me cry for reals as crushed ice i was offended i wasn t featured in this

well done it is mindblowing i wish i can do food bending i d be the fricking avatar thank you so much for all the smiles and laughs the most we have seen of this man include his hands fore arm and elbow ysac is an expert hamon user and a master chef what more can you ask for can we talk about how long this would actually take this is truly amazing i think i solved it casuallyexplained and ysac are the same person as a fan of both channels i can say that 1 ce was open about being born in tasmania an aussie state and even spoke with the accent during ysacs tikka masala video you can hear his aussie accent coming through 2 ysac lives near the ocean and can be seen in a thick nw north american wilderness in the guacamole video ce was clear about being from victoria a city in southwestern b c along the pacific ocean i have been to victoria many times and can say that the area in his video is very similar 3 ysac and ce both did a video together and you can hear the slight difference the mic makes plus why would a cartoon channel and a cooking channel meet with all these similarities day 9 of quarantine humans has finally discovered aqua baking this was a waste of time you re welcome for existing you suck a cookings super power is to change food into other food in different ways he messes with her i love this i m pretty sure these are simple hard cuts but they re done so

chunks you ve brightened my day in quarantine oddly therapeutic oddly therapeutic i had a very lucid nightmare once that included a thanks for existing message many years ago it was a sunny day in summer i was 25 walking down a road when i was suddenly transported 50 years into the future as i lay on my deathbed in a low lying swamp with trees surrounding me an alien shapeshifter with the body of a upside down isosceles triangle and floating oval head advanced on me and i died still in the conscious part of death there was black and some yellow writing appeared to say thank you for existing god exists followed by a cryptic mathematical problem 57 5 7 55 which started to fade into the nothingness that was death contradictory to the first message as my consciousness tired to grasp the fading formula i quickly woke up glad to be conscious am i reading a youtube comment or drinking ayahuasca you suck at cooking i ve never wrote about this lucid nightmare online my 1 favourite youtuber replies i think i forgot to breathe dude your content is amazing if i had some money i d buy the book you made my favourite is the sandwich of justice if i had to think quickly but every

deserve to take up space and damn i still think about it at least once a week when you learn a new editing trick and you use it literally everywhere the leek had me what if none of this is movie magic what if he s just freakishly strong the last one made me like the video ysac is what happens when an op anime protagonist decides to take up cooking i imagine you secretly look like steve buscemi last time is was this early none of the eggs had been murdered brate al sam brz a far better cooking advice than of those five minute things i wonder how many little bits of vegetable is behind this guy s stove always makes my day to see a new video up from you thank you for existing and sharing wait so to cook i need to have a camera and the ability to edit videos even for wanglangled eggs did did the leak just got a leak ysac is so good at editing that i m convinced that it s not even editing anymore and that he just holds enough power to dice an onion just by punching it makes me wonder what could he do just by looking at food lol you fucking don t what editing he does don t you never let ysac hold your child no thank you for existing you kitchen god this is what quality skill looks like awesome content my guy thank you my guy he just wanna flex on us is this re uploaded i m getting vietnamese flashbacks or some kind of deja vu satisfaction you re a good and cleaner version of howtobasic and without eggs i expect an actual cooking tutorial on 1st april when you suck at cooking but rock at editing this is the oddly satisfying stuff you should actually see when u see a title named oddly satisfying underrated comment or maybe no one saw this yet kuro sensei thx ma dude this corona thing is messing with your head too fucking love these and thank you for such amazing content

editing is so fun to watch maek porc chap poeta chop proc chp0 cross chorp pork chop yesu did ity what am i doing with my life somebody help me i could watch your hands all day he scared an onion good because now it s there turn to cry 1 28 thanks for reminding me i do love some fantasy physics i needed this chuckle thanks ysac no food was wasted during the making of this video now he s just flexing his editing skills hey ysac thank you for existing genius hehe best video i came across this night thanks for existing this video hit me so hard it gave me a concussion is this what it s like cooking if your a jedi this is the first time i ve heard music in the background of a ysac video godlike editing skills honestly this guy should be on mortal kombat 381st i wish i could fix my life as elegantly as he cuts vegetables 0 10 i can t be the only one who sees a bunch of ugly floating tomatoes with faces right how must one acquire a haunted knife when you want to show off your editing skills lol trick food pls help i turned my rommate into babies hooh major editing flexing going on today i like how you doin love all 41 of these tricks still need to work on my wangjangle though man the first time i saw one of your videos i thought to myself what a weirdo nowadays i can only smile and make happy wangjangle noises great editing i mean cooking skill these are always my favorite part a whole video of them is my dream come true it would be cool if it was like this in reality ripple chopping and tons of time saved d my personal favorite food trick is stealing the finished food from my future self the only issue is my past self keeps stealing from me this video reminds me of fresh guacamole by pes plz watch it if you haven t i need one of those haunted knives i think its time for a face reveal this is me just realizing i needed this dang your magic skills are amazing how many whacks and or rolls are needed to reach the atomic level of vegetables it s exponential so we get cabbage to powder in three whacks i d say just two or three more probably the asparagus is the best i too like to live dangerously i wanna try the auto chop anyone have a good ghost that wouldn t mind haunting the knife for a few you can get them from the occult stores they sell ghosts in jars in different varieties friendly not so friendly not friendly at all and oh god no d the last variety works the best but don t expect it to leave by itself the best way to get rid of it is to purify the knife with holy water then throw it in the holy fire and let it melt and after all that you bury it as deep as humanly possible the deeper the better d orpheus1782 idk some places don t sell those just the ritual summoning components those are never on sale orpheus1782 thanks for the advice but i heard those stores are soooo expensive u can find one on craigslist jen sanaa then do some weeeird rituals and you get it for some other price than money like your soul d kitkat only if you pay me enough can t you just catch one with a vacuum cleaner use the knife to create a ghost if you know what i mean you can usually find pre haunted knives in the beyond section of bed bath and beyond actually you re gonna want a poltergeist for that not just your regular run of the mill ghost it s a common error a lot of amateur chefs make when they re first starting out i d say ebay has haunted dolls but no responsible parent would give a knife to a child ask my grandma kitkat can i borrow the knife i want to try out ripple chop sorry mines busy all week thank you ysac i hope you re having a wonderful day too you seriously need a show on food network hes just fleksing his editing powers i m wearing a tank top rn so there s also a gun show happening i want to bet you had to clear vegetables off your wall at least 10 times how am i meant to hunt for my wild ingredients if we re not allowed to go outside now how about wangjangling some mayo pods till you make them bleed and it becomes 1000 islands sause i ve been sending people in quarantine to check out your channel and they ve been enjoying it keep up the good work and please stay safe thank you you too wash those hands and also other parts of your body you suck at cooking like uh your spleen i m not finding the step by step guide in your book on how to do this you can show us 1000 times but some of us need literature to follow sir the thing is that you didn t cook stuck at home because of covid good thing i stocked up on mayo pods thank you for existing i cried right weirdest thing i probably ever commented but i ve been watching this channel for ages anyone else find his voice and sense of humour like really appealing if you get what i mean you horny bastard simp simp lol everyone saying simp hot voice for sure his voice is soothing and humor is typical british everything sucks so just do it whatever way that is exactly why i ve been watching these videos beferrr definitely agree on the british humour we get it you are amazing at editing no hate tho you re my fav food channel thank you very much i appreciate that always love this man great content as always that last one is why they call it a jalapeno popper this is the video i ve been wanting for years and didn t realize it what should i eat for dinner cauliflower mac and cheese this looks like it took so much effort he lives in

food powers the f cking leek surprised no other channels don t tell us to just roll our foods thank you ysac very informative np last time i was this early yeah i m never this early after effects its

for years hi i like your videos they are really funny and cool i sing ur intro to my mom cause it s wholesome no thank you for existing i keep putting too much force and my onion disintegrates into powder oh i get it it s a jalape o popper i don t think i ve ever fully appreciated how seamless and impressive these cuts are legit these look professional exactly every single one leaves me wondering how he did it i mean i now a bit of premiere stuff myself but the bouncing of grated and chopped vegetables how does he achieve that what cuts this is how you cook yea it must have been hard to have his hands in the right place every time spicybean tofu exactly i don t get why people are so confused they are professional im not hating on you or him but its not really hard to do at all peanut butter one was obvious that s because he is one spicybean tofu they re talking about the video cuts and transitions not the actual food lmao job muiles ikr lol jenna akemi wow really are professional the editing in this video is unreal that this will be the real way of cooking some years later i get always shell pieces into my guacamole when i crack the avocado do you have some expertise to avoid that thanks a lot use 7 forks you suck at cooking what s about the asian guys in china that doesn t own forks or asia fanatic people nils r 77 chopsticks augment with 1 spoon if necessary yay this reminds me of zach king red skittles are the devil so with this math you can throw a bolt of paper at a wall you get a bunch of paper towels then if you throw the paper towels at the wall you ll end up with toilet paper we all know this however if you throw it again do you get receipt paper instructions not clear hands are now in pieces had yt on 1 5x speed so these quick food tricks were actually fast food tricks when the eggs this guy s editing skills have increased exponentially correction this guy s skills have increased exponentially what do you mean editing these are different shots for many of his videos new and old luvely 106 ow that is what is edited i thought it looked a bit strange like the corona virus curve saberbowen lol simpsonwave not the right decade to say that mate maybe 2 years and its a meme my powers has doubled since last we met thatssosketchy are you good at scavenger hunts i need help on this youtube challenge watch v nni7rthrwpk editing what editing its all skill ha good one editing i had to read this comment like 10 times before i understood what you wanted to say haha paula sof a contreras overwhelming majority that he didn t edit

wow early enough so i can get the oven into the undo at three twenty fundo and wangjangle my soup nice music unique imagine someone actually searching up food tricks and they come across this video james pan knowing how deadly asparagus is they d never use it again dats probly how most of us got here how howtobasic got famous no doubt it actually shows up when you search food tricks lucky

second video that pops up who searches up food tricks randombuzzer me what are you talking about everyone of them worked i just searched food tricks and this is the first thing that comes up james pan

whoosh coming this way pfft idunno no he is right the edited part is when he slows the cutting for us to not get lost you should watch how2basic he always uses all his ingredients in his cooking and
