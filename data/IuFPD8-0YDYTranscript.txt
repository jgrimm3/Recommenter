 we re a couple months in but we already know it s gonna be a pretty big year for the playstation 4 hi folks its falcon and today on game ranks the top 30 new ps4 games of 2020 starting off at number 30 it s predator hunting grounds a new asymmetrical shooter in which some interesting ideas are experimented with first off its not just incredibly powerful monster guy versus four other guys obviously the idea is to escape the team has to get away from the predator and to the choppa yes i said it that way no you can t do anything about it and the team also has other objectives besides survive with the predator having some elements balanced to make it more of a challenge for instance all of his abilities all of his abilities and weapons are tied to a single battery i don t know this one s got some serious potential they re doing a multiplayer trial on march 27th and predator hunting grounds will fully launch april 24th at number 29 is marvel s ironman vr an exclusive ps vr game in which you play as tony stark in the ironman suit now obviously watching somebody else play a vr game isn t quite the same as playing yourself but what we ve seen of it is pretty impressive it looks like it s a lot of fun the presentation i ve watched where they ve done a demo the person playing the game tends to get involved in it to a point where they stop listening to the other people and i take that as a good sign because i want to fly around as ironman i want to shoot lasers out of my hands it sounds like a good time and you know i m gonna be giving it a shot when it comes out on playstation 4 may 15 at number 28 is persona 5 royal which isn t just adding a few more characters or a few more scenarios adding another semester to the game a lot of fanservice including a new area where you can do team building stuff playing pool playing darts and of course it s persona 5 how could you not want to play persona 5 it s just an amazing game but this is a much bigger version of persona 5 with tons more content being added to the seminal jrpg persona 5 royals come in march 31st at number 27 is the pathless this is i mean just in every way a beautiful looking game it s coming to us by way of giant squid studios who most recently gave us the incredible ads ooh the pathless is a mythic adventure game where you play as an archer accompanied by a trusty eagle with the objective of hunting various corrupted spirits now what exactly that means i don t know but what we ve seen of this game which admittedly is not a lot is gorgeous and looks incredibly fun the pathless will be hitting sometime this year at 26 is yakuza like a dragon which is going to basically be an overhaul of yakuza it s not an action game it s a jrpg turn based specifically and honestly i think it could work i m at least optimistic about it although i m a little bit confused is it a spin off or is this a totally new direction for the series i m not sure that said their intent is to make a game that is quite a bit different than yakuza and i don t necessarily think that that s a bad thing we ll see when yok is a like a dragon hit sometime 2020 and number 25 is wild an open world survival game coming to us from wild sheep studio a game set in the neolithic period where you have access to some shamanic powers like possessing animals which we ll use to spy on other people as you attempt to survive in a large procedurally generated world wild sheep studio the creator was founded by the creator of rayman and beyond good and evil to playstation classics this is a game that s been in development for a long time we haven t heard a lot about it but we ve got our fingers crossed for 2020 at 24s grand blue fantasy versus a fighting game based on the rpg grand blue fantasy that manages to really look like a 2d fighting game without really being one what s interesting is it will have a fighting game and a story mode which is essentially a beat em of as in with bosses and co op and that sounds cool as hell grand blue fantasy is hitting in north america on march 3rd at number 23 is soccer wars what is billed as a cross genre game it s an action rpg a dating sim of the novel you know it really runs the gamut it s also interestingly enough built on a hedgehog engine and contains several developers from sonic so you know that there s some weirdness involved you ve got demons to fight but yeah this is the sixth mainline soccer wars game and it s apparently a soft reboot it does definitely look like something a little different and that s not necessarily a bad thing soccer wars is coming out april 28 at number 22 is beyond good and evil 2 the sequel to the cult classic the space pirate adventure game and information is pretty sparse on this game and there s a good chance we ll be waiting quite awhile for it perhaps even into 2021 however this game bears a mention anyway the original was really a lot of fun had tons of personality and it was a long time ago so it s really cool that we re getting a sequel slash prequel sometime in the future beyond good and evil 2 we don t know when it s coming out but it s hopefully this year and number 21 is dreams the game art creation thing i ve been playing dreams for a while now i really enjoy it i did that before you buy for it it s oddly intuitive it s really cool looking and i m still not a lot better at it however there s a lot more content growing all the time on this platform and it s amazing to jump into other people s creations sometimes it s astounding when you consider the idea that a game is basically just something somebody made in their free time if you re interested in more on that look at my before you buy dreams is already out it s definitely worth the ticket price at number 20 is dragon ball z kakarot a retelling of the dragon ball saga as an open world game now this game is not without its flaws however it s also really probably the definitive video game retelling of this saga on top of that it s a lot of fun with a few novel approaches at some rpg staples that in a lot of ways keeps it simple without being dumb dragon ball z kakarot is out now at number 19 it s mlb the show 20 the latest iteration of the major league baseball game vastly expands the minor league which was previously very gen now has fully licensed players it will be interesting to see what they do after last year s game which was pretty good and received a fair amount of praise mlb the show 20 is coming out march 17th and number 18 is outriders which comes to us from people can fly the developers of bulletstorm and gears of war judgment out writers looks to maintain a fair amount of influence from gears of war up writers is a three player co op centric title set in a post apocalyptic world it also has a fair set of rpg elements i don t know it looks really intriguing to me and i definitely want to give it a shot when it comes out sometime this year at number 17 is ubisoft s gods and monsters coming to us from the creators of assassin s creed odyssey it is taking a very clear influence from legend of zelda breath of the wild of course however it s obviously steeped in greek mythology and we don t know exactly to what extent it will be following the breath of the wild formula my guess is play wise it s probably going to be a little bit closer to assassin s creed odyssey with some breadth of the wild elements thrown in we don t have a release date it is hitting sometime this year though and we re looking forward to it a great deal and number 16 is neo 2 which looks to give you a little more freedom in that you create your character at the start personally i hope this isn t at the detriment to the game part of what made neo very good was actually the protagonist that doesn t mean that i don t welcome character creation in neo 2 i do as well as simply welcoming a lot more neo action seriously this is the sequel to one of the best souls like games out there and number 15 is skull and bones the open world naval combat game which is based on the naval play from assassin s creed black flag and that is great this is a game that we ve known about for quite a while was announced quite a while back and frankly i ve been on board since the beginning the ship play from assassin s creed black flag but as a full game yes that s it i m ready we do not have a specific date but skull and bones is coming sometime this year supposedly at number 14 is disintegration a very different looking game set in a post apocalyptic earth we re human brains are inside robot bodies the game is touting the idea of a grave cycle which is a hover motorcycle that s pretty cool and the world itself it exists in is pretty cool obviously we re going to need more information is kind of minimal now but the trailers look phenomenal disintegration is coming sometime this year at number 13 is kerbal space program an ambitious upgrade coming to us from star theory games different developer where we ll be seeing a large amount of new types of propulsion we ll be seeing colonies honestly it looks like a pretty drastically expanded game which is what we need from a new developer trying to prove themselves with what is honestly just a phenomenal game we don t have a specific release date but kerbal space program is coming sometime this year and number 12 is to destroy all humans remake a game that i am ever so here for destroy all humans is a classic i love it i think it s funny i think it s fun and i m extremely excited to see them totally remaking it with all of the original voice acting for all intents and purposes looks like they re sticking pretty close to the original albeit with much better graphics and that s what i want seriously if you ve never played this game this is one you have to consider i loved destroy all humans the games currently slated for spring we don t have a date yet but really looking forward to it at number 11 is marvel s avengers which we ve been anticipating for quite a while we saw a lot of what this game is going to be fairly recently in a lot of ways it looks to take some cues from the spider man ps4 game as well as throwing in a lot of cinematic stuff some cuties and honestly it looks like it might be shaping up to be a pretty interesting game the plot is certainly a bit different taking place after superheroes being outlawed for the most part anyways it was delayed but mainly to make the game better before release it s always hard to criticize that kind of a reason i would always rather have a better game and it s coming september 4th at number 10 is lego star wars the skywalker saga you have to know what lego star wars as at this point it s an action adventure game with fun gameplay and a lot of silly humor sat in the star wars this will span the entire nine movie saga i know a lot of people are going to enjoy this game and that s not just children although children will probably be all over it in truth the lego star wars games have always been a ton of fun i ve always enjoyed them and i ll play this we don t have a specific date but it s coming this year at number 9 is watchdogs legion the third in the watchdogs series also possibly the most intriguing scenario it s set in a post brexit alternate future in which london has become a police state you are setting up the resistance of course ctos is responsible for everything and in a police state that s kind of scary i think it s honestly a pretty good idea on account the previous games were set in a ctos rising situation obviously ctos was implemented but this is a different ballgame watchdogs legion will hit sometime this year at number 8 is vampire the masquerade bloodlines the sequel to the 2004 cult classic video game bloodlines takes place in 21st century seattle just around christmas essentially it s an alternate world in which vampires demons werewolves etc are the driving force behind a lot of the world s events you re a thin blood vampire who is transformed in a big attack that rogue vampires caused and are basically thrust into an entirely new world we don t have a date but vampire the masquerade bloodlines we ll be hitting some time this year and a number 7 is eldon ring the collaboration with from software and george rr martin that everyone is looking forward to it s basically an open world take on the genre that from birth these souls born souls like whatever you want to call it jon rrah with lore and story brought to us by one of the most celebrated modern authors out there george rr martin i don t know how you could go wrong with this it seems like a stretch to imply it could go bad i m of course very excited for this one we don t yet have a specific release date however it is supposed to come this year number six is doom eternal i don t really know how on earth you could not want doom eternal the doom 2016 reboot is a hell of a lot of fun nope intended and this is a bigger version of that with a grappling hook shotgun i ve said it in other videos grappling hook shotgun is basically all that needs to be said and i am there i have zero complaints about anything i ve seen for doom eternal so far other than the idea that it s not out yet it will be hitting sometime this year however and you can bet i will be fair at number five is the resident evil 3 remake i m particularly excited about this game on account some of it takes place before resident evil 2 the rest after and resident evil 3 is a fantastic game on itself knowing the treatment that resin evil 2 got for its remake i m extremely excited to see this yes i absolutely want to play resident evil 3 like the resident evil 2 remake that s hitting april 3rd 2020 be there and number 4 is ghosts of tsushima a beautiful looking action adventure game with elements of stealth and a large open world the goal that sucker punch productions set out to fulfill was to create something that made you feel like you were becoming a samurai of course in every possible way i want that the game is set on tsushima island the last obstacle between the conquering mongol empire and mainland japan yeo jin the protagonists have to learn the way of the ghost ghosts of tsushima will be out in the fall at number 3 is cyberpunk 2077 how could you not want this game i mean this is basically technology grand theft auto played from a first person perspective with the depth of witcher 3 wild hunt perhaps some more this is another game that got delayed by a little while again when a developer wants to achieve a certain quality however it s really hard to argue with but it s going to be hard to wait for september 17th for cyberpunk 2077 to release at number two is the final fantasy 7 remake speaking of cyberpunk this is actually the first in several installments that we ll be seeing final fantasy 7 3 make released in this one being set in midgar honestly final fantasy 7 is perhaps one of the coolest most interesting long form games i ve played in my life that says so much about the world we while being totally absurd seriously if you spend any amount of time thinking about the scenario this game that s very silly however actually really easy to get lost in final fantasy 7 3 makes hitting april 10 and finally the big one the last of us obviously we all want the last of us the last of us ended in such a way that of course we want to know what happened clearly people are surviving however it s not the same as the authoritarian police state we re talking about living in the wilderness aside from knowing that the major characters return we don t know a lot about the gameplay although it s safe to assume it will be a lot like the first or the story despite that it s last of us how could you not want last of us and it s hitting on may 29th and as a quick bonus for you rainbow six quarantine which is based of course inspired by the rainbow six siege outbreak event it s a three player co op hunt of a technological parasite and honestly it looks pretty good however with one caveat there s a decent chance it s gotten delayed and may not come until early next year dying light the sequel to the parkour zombie game which looks to expand greatly on player choice and its impact on narrative dying light got delayed indefinitely so if we don t see it in 2020 i m not gonna
