lol honey in your pizza dough really simple and tasty thanks a lot sir hey vito do you ever use milk i do that and everyone who has my base says it s the best hello may i know the temperature if i

turbando il riposo narcisetto adoncino d amor beautifully done video and pizza thank you well done vito i will make your recipe this weekend for my wife thankyou for how to make this looks awesome i ll have to give this a crack one day cheers mate for this recipe with 1 500kg of flour you use 25g of salt but in your other video with 1 700kg of flour you use 50g of salt something s got to be wrong bravo vito ho appena sottoscritto al tuo canale mi piaciuto molto anche la ricetta con la pasta acida biga only 5gr of yeast are you sure seems low for 1 5kg of four i m probably missing something here but can someone tell me where the us conversion of this recipe is ok its 12 5 cups flour 4 1 4 cups water i d start with 4 cups and add a little more as needed 1 1 2 tbls salt 2 tsp honey i packet active dry yeast or 3 tsp you can also halve this recipe which i do it makes about 4 12 14 inch pizzas you could translate the recipe as percentages in comparison of flour as 100 awesome i love it hi i have been experimenting and trying different recipes and techniques for about a two years may be more last night decided to go with that one with dry yeast usually fan of fresh yeast this was the best pizza result i achieved i have regular electric oven and kneading with my two hands for 15 min intensive another benefit of vito s videos was to replace the pizza stone with the stock metal plate which is coming with the oven i just turned upside down it reached 287 c stone never went over 267 c crust was totally better than before i will not use another recipe and my stone never again thank you too many ads correction way too many ads i m 4 mins in and there s been three sets already i use chrome and the adblocker plugin no ads jlee29170 by doing that the creators get absolutely nothing you do realize that right while i think having too many ads is being a little greedy blocking the ads is being a little rude to the creators i have a channel too and we depend on that income using an ad blocker screws us over eventually if every one does that youtube will go the way of the dodo because if they can t pay creators no one will want to spend the time and effort needed to make a channel just made the dough 1 litre of water is way too much waaay too much well you saw that he made 7 dough ball with that its beautiful thank you from algeria why does the top part need to stay on top he means you don t have to touch it because of air fermentation is you touch the top also while making balls your pizza will loose the ability to grow up during the rest and also during the cooking the ability in making a good and light pizza is in two parts while creating the mix and how to touch it after watching hundreds of videos regarding pizza dough i ve come to the conclusion that pizza dough recipes are like assholes everybody has a different one but they all stink 2 day to make a pizza dough are you kidding me i make my pizza dough in and have a ready to eat pizza in less than two hours and it tastes as good as any other pizza i have ever eaten in any of the best pizza places around even better than the one in italy or new york to be honest my pizza rocks i am the pizza king now this guy has a wooden box to make the starter give me a break if you are making a recipe which people can use at home why use something people most likely will not have at home bologna grazie ottimo tutoraggio viva italia ho donato 4 dollari far di pi visto che sei bravo e sai cucinare diversamente dagli americani thanks very nice of you to share your recipe for pizza dough what you need to watch on this video is technique dough recipes are pretty much the same with some variations in hydration the how you work your dough means everything i tried a lot of dough recipes and they all pretty much sucked i was working a batch got frustrated and tossed it in the fridge overnight and guess what it fixed it doh pun intended can not rush good dough i use a recipe that is almost identical sugar instead of honey and it wants that 8 hours i like 24 hours now if i could do a round pie i am expert at triangles rectangles free from blobs round just does not happen i like ny pizza it can be frozen how long do you cook it in the oven and for how long until it s as cooked as you want it can you use fresh yeast if so do you use the same amount wow so good so yummy piza your pizza looks great no question about it but you title your video pizza for the house the big thing about a pizza is not so much about the dough as it is about the cooking method in your video you are using a wood fired brick oven nobody has that at home it probably cost 20 000 the reality of cooking a pizza at home is using a regular stove oven i m sure if you cooked your pizza in a more realistic and down to earth oven you d never get the results that you show in your video look you make a great pizza but it s not something that ordinary people with ordinary tools can achieve i loves that video lol i bet his pizza is insane must try this smh why in the world would over 2k people give you a thumbs down me proudly thumbs up along with a standing o really bad look in the end of the pizza bravissimo do you deliver here in brazil cool i follwed the recipe exactly as written 1500 kg of flour it didn t work out what went wrong great video been making and loving pizzas for years but like to see videos like yours that show the passion for making great pizzas my italian wife says you a sound just a like her cuginos bon appitto thank you very much for uploading this video liked 75k more videos please what do i put my kitchen oven at and how long as hot as you can get it until it s cooked redrisotto hold on let me write that down salam jihad it s true though you can t get a home oven

bumbyies like me take your time youre the best buddy i like this video thumbs up fantastico vito this and the fresh yeast one for home are brilliant i look forward to trying this one next weekend might be an early start if you put the balls in the fridge after the 8 hours to keep do you need to bring them back to room temperature before using or can you stretch them straight from the fridge cheers jim he is so handsome that dough is a trainwreck why not make a keto pizza great which flour combination could be used for a gluten free pizza i have tested many they are good but never as good as a real pizza and not as good as gluten free pizza in roma i can t wait to make a vegan pizza with this dough thank you so much i learned how to do my favorite food thank you vito great job i ll try this tomorrow it s a wet dough and will take longer to rise than my standby i m sure this will up my game hi from florida this is my 2nd time trying this first time crust was not bubbly tasted great though could you please translate this recipe into cups i m having a difficult time trying to figure out how much flour to use used 8 cups to start then 620 grams for finish lil over 6 cups did i do this correctly hugs thank you love your channel maestro can you correct the recipe in the description 1 l water 1 5 kg flour 66 hydration or 1000 grams aqua 1500 grams harina 66 hydration harina de 1500 kg 3307 pounds more than your fiat so cool italia cool fantastic method like the video gonne make it now normaly i would use 5 gr of yeast for 500gr of flour though oh and in the video you say 10 gr of miel honey in the discription it says 5 gr anyway im of baking pizza video says 10 g honey printed says 5 g which is correct you re awesome love your passion and you are a fantastic teacher thanks for all your amazing instructional videos 2 08 lol did you just toss the bowl does the dough taste better if i add tipo 00 flour instead of all purpose ok the pizza almost ready uhm no the pizza was ready before you burnt it the burnt bits are the best you must not know good pizza friend i ll pray for you tonite alex gonzalez well thank you for the prayers we all certainly need more of them in these times we are living in but god has no plans for manipulating people s brains into thinking something that burnt is the best part o from what i have experienced throughout my whole life is that well over the majority of people don t like their pizza and a lot of other foods to be burnt and especially not that burnt if anything most people including myself like pizza to have that just barely on the verge of becoming burnt o get the lead out 45 yea man totally but ur still wrong alex gonzalez actually i m totally right and i m not saying that coming from having an egotistical problem i m saying that because anyone with a sound mind knows i and nobody else shouldn t have to prove it by going to look up and provide you with the actual studies and statistics for those studies which undeniably proves that well over the majority of people don t like their pizza and a lot of other foods to be burnt if anything most people like their pizza to have that just barely on the verge of becoming burnt and even if i provided you those independent studies that proves well over the majority of people don t like burnt pizza you seem like you re just going to argue it anyways how about this i can easily admit that maybe where you are located there are more people who like their pizza being as burnt as you prepared it in this video but then how about you just simply admit the facts for how most people in the world do not like their pizza being burnt o i mean i definitely dont want to argue with you ok if you are the same guy that s in this video you seem like a nice guy o gettheleadout45 completely agree at 11 10 can even see one the totally burnt parts is like 3inches by 2inches and thats not just merely burnt bits like hes saying but are actually large sections thats burnt i mean don t get me wrong i sometimes like tiny burnt bits but definitely not when their such large burnt pieces never ever buy a thing advertised before a video 1500 kg equates to 3300 pounds of flour it s never this easy love this video very thorough and detailed keep them coming the recipe is great if you own an italian restaurant or pizzeria but i see no way to reduce this recipe for the family dinner without knowing how many pizza crusts this recipe will make if i knew that i could do the math if i d like to freeze the dough balls should i put it into freezer right after making small dough balls 7 30 or after 6 8hr of final fermentation when they will be flat 7 58 yo cuss love your vids but you have to move that little doll though i love off camera or the snowflakes will come after you here is the recipe of the real neapolitan pizza but not and as you make it 1 liter of water 50 g of salt 3 g of fresh brewer s yeast 1 g is sufficient for dry yeast 1 7 1 8 kg of type 00 flour these are the ingredients dude i like your accent that pizza would be sent back to the kitchen the crust is burnt you were professional since you were 8 years old child labor use 1 5kg at my house are you joking this guy is just too cute for freaking words i just smile the whole time he talks very good thankyou why does my pizza dough stick to the wrap after the 6 8 hours it also looks very collapsed is it ok if my room temperature is 30 c grazie in anticipo thanks for sharing my dear i love it how much italian vito iacopelli yes i was a bit confused at first unfortunately i m used to freedom units here in the us do i check for the window pane test i made this and it s shockingly good not fast and not easy but worth it poke the bubbles down so that shit doesnt burn it s the oven that created the crust that way not technique and ingredients regular home over can never give that kind of crust try putting a pizza stone very high in the oven then turning oven on broil wait till the stone gets very very hot before putting pizza in i get cooking times of about 120 180 seconds best we can do with regular ovens warning i made this recipe and i cannot recommend using 25g of salt for 1 5 kg s of flour i love vito s work and he has taught me pretty much everything know about making pizza but 25g of salt resulted in a pretty bland dough i recommend closer to 3 of the flour amount so around 45g of salt should be good thanks so much vito i m using your method right now so far so good with the dough i will share this with my pizza luvin friends question i made this today and it s very tasty but it s thin and the edges aren t at all fluffy airy there where lots of small bubbles in the dough but none that seemed as big as they did in the video any idea where i went wrong have you got a video on making pizza with sourdough 1500kg of flour easy and fast loool d make the dough wait 1 hour re make its after wait 7 8 hours is it fast dd but the dough is good voila thanks to this pizza dough i just get laid with the most hot chic in town grazie mille vito this guy really knows his stuff i am very happy with the results i have gotten using the techniques from his videos great video thanks go and watch citalia tgen make a new video video description says 1500kg flour better go fix that some people probably already bought 1 5 tons of flour no easy is picking up a digiorno and sticking in the microwave love the pizza tutorials that shows a guy using a professional oven or a wood fired oven yeah everybody has at least one at home thanks made this for dinner and it was fantastic i let it proof for 30hrs in the fridge instead and crust turned out crisp and chewy thank you 11 39 was as bad is you not taking a bite i m hungry as hell so excited will try it thank u so much black bubbles matter to all the thumbs down dummies what kind of dry yeast maestro i m in the united kingdom thanks for the amazing video nice were do i get the wood dough bowl my nona used to have one till it crack grazie per la ricetta una fantastica crosta di pizza dio vi benedica e continuate a fare il buon lavoro ciao vito you are amazing very good but i think oil and water will compete at the douth hydratation may god bless u maestro the best part of any pizza is the dough please stop using plastic wrap it s just stupid wasteful fuck that is something so basic but why do i have to tell you are you seriously telling me i ll have to wait around 10 hours to make a pizza triple the amount of dry yeast watch it grow in 40 minutes there you have it i will just order no this is not the best way of making dough you have to put balls in the fridge for 24 or even 48 hours but you made it in room temperature so it is acidic and very plastic and that is not good for digesting also virgin olive oil is very unhealthy over 150 c so avoid using it before cooking instead virgin use common olive oil for cooking which can handle higher tempretaures extra virgin oil is for finishing or putting it in or under the tomato sauce also not every flour is good for baking best mixture is hardened flour with about 8 of corn flour and avoid using plastic in contact with fresh or hot food whenever and wherever you can use natural materials such as stone cotton and wood perch e quale miele consigli per la pizza al posto del pizzico di zucchero at 75f room temperature at 0 33 active dry yeast that dough was ready to use after 3 hours the salt amount 1 6 is a little low increasing it to 30 grams 2 would make it taste better also honey and sugar are interchangeable in pizza dough rock on how if we add some of buttermilk to dough guy you put chinese and spanish description where the fuck are the imperial measurements looks so good margherita pizza is my favorite 1 26 ten grams of a pure annie i love it awesome grazie brother vito pizza is life and you are doing god s work bless you my son may a good pizza grace us all amen grazie mille tu now i have to run to damn walmart and get one of those terrible tasting frozen pizzas great video thanks i am sick of the lying bloomberg ads so nicely made i want to look when it slice anything she wants best thank you yes i like to your make it but i woul like to something about how to make for soft powder and eny topping thanks guess i m going to california for pizza i have been making pizza for about 10 years or i thought i d been making pizza until i saw this this is without a doubt one of the best videos i have ever seen on how to make pizza i haven t been making the dough wet enough and the proving has been wrong as well many many thanks it s even better when you eat it fresh and hot from his wood stove are you sure 1500kg flour i used 1500grams and it came out perfect u measured 1500grams and it was all good how many pizzas did you have in the end or how many dough balls did u have in the end i copied this recipe but it did not work i was so upset then i looked at the date on my dry yeast and it was 4 years out of date nice smile men don t wear skinny jeans if i use fresh yeast how much for 1 kilogram of flour please sub this look s amaizing can you say tablespoons and cups instead of grams wait for an hour then for another hour then for 6 8 hours and he says the dough we mad easy and fast lol amazing recepie though and it works hey if i want to freeze it at what step should i do it i think i would do it at 6 55 directly on the pan and after wraps thems in bags and when defreezing it let it outside the fridge for 6 8 hours or should i freeze thems after the 6 8 hours is it better to leave dough balls to ferment rest for 6 8 hours at room temperature then place in refrigerator for 48 hours or once dough balls are formed place directly into refrigerator for 48 hours 5 grams of honey or 10 grams video says 10 grams description says 5 grams thank you in advance description says also 10 grams great where can i get the dough box featured its actually such a great idea to minimise mess hearing his blood pulse is killing me lol why are you yelling at me this pizza looks the best of the world super friendly and perfect explanation wonderful congratulations i can t wait to make this recipe ever hear of cups tsp tbsp etc quit watching after 30 sec s cups are a dumbass measurement for flour or anything baking related very helpful thank you gotta admit stretching the pizza dough is pretty difficult indeed lol shut up clown and make my pizza hey vito love your videos we do have a woodfired oven and have tried many doughs what do you recommend for crispy crust some of these look crispy on the edge but limp in the middle is that just the way it is also have you done videos on ingredients always wonder what the best cheeses are pepperoni want the pepperoni to cup and char thanks oh look burnt thats why i dont like neapolitan style pizza it taste like licking a piece of charcoal dough is good but the style of the pizza meh can t wait to try this look so good thanks for sharing question can i put the left over pizza dough in the freezer if so how long is it good to stay in the freezer grazie tanti excellent presentation thank you for sharing and thank you for your hard work maestro the tradition receipt for neopolitan pizza like you showed on other video is fresh yeast 1 2 grams for every 1 kilo of flower and let it rest for 6 8 hours in room temperature in this receipt the dry yeast its like a 10 gram of fresh yeast and same time of resting do i miss something hi vito after six hours my douh looks like a balloon it s fills like foam not even near to what i see in your vid and another thing the tradition receipt for neopolitan pizza like you showed on other video is fresh yeast 1 2 grams for every 1 kilo of flower and let it rest for 6 8 hours in room temperature in this receipt the dry yeast its like a 10 gram of fresh yeast and same time of resting do i miss something thank you vito will make the dough now and let you know how was the pizza this is the perfect pizza dough recipe it gave me a perfect rise all around in my home oven thank you so much did you make it with the same amount of the flour like vito or goca wot nope i halved the quantity of all the ingredients except for the yeast kept that the same amount 5g parthvi gyan ok you did it with 750 gr of flour and 500 ml of water i am little bit concerned about that thanks again have a nice day goca wot i understand the result is a very very wet and sticky dough but with a little bit of kneading it worked just fine have a great day eh vito can i freeze the dough prefect i tried thank you for sharing forgot to take a bite d bravoo dry east and pure annie amazing apriciated hello all does anyone know if he used instant yeast or dried active yeast apparently there are different types that require different quantities to many commercials anyone else sick and tired of these patrick stewart groveling commercials wow finally got best pizza recipe i can possibly make in standard oven on a simple tray didn t leave the dough to rest much and it s still perfecto did you make it with same amount of flour like vito or less curious once you have gotten to the stage of balling the dough could you place the balls in air tight containers and place in the fridge for 48 hours to use later if so how long would you recommend resting once taken out cheers did anyone try the recipe at home i did and i believe 1 litre of water is too much for 1 5kg of flour i had to use more to get the right consistency just looking at the video in the beginning it doesn t even look like the amount of water he s pouring is 1l exscellent work mayestro thank u and god bless u for helping me to make home made pizza you are lovely guys thank you i didn t like burn pizza thank you for the recipe i ll try 1500 kg of flour wow damn pizza boner you slap that dough like it s a woman s ass lol i take it that wasn t fast action yeast you used then vito great video vito thankyou i have a question obviously if you want to make less pizzas for at home its easy to divide the dough recipe into 2 or 4 pizzas etc but should you would it change the proving times thanks again what was the temperature of the water used cold or 110f as they suggest with instant dry yeast looks great but the secret to amazing crust is having a real pizza oven hi the pizza look soooo amazing i usually make the dough overnight because i don t have time in the morning for all the proofing so can i prepare the dough and leave it proof at room tempt for about 10 hrs or is it best for about 14 hrs in the fridge will the dough have a strong yeast smell if i proof it too long as room tempt just made the dough but don t know what is best thanks looks perfect it s the best recipe thanks beautiful best video yet and makes sense cuz yeast and salt dont mix at first but once the yeast done its job u can add the salt si ok ma il miele cazzo ci azzecca grazia bella i like your voice accent btw i see some people using soft low gluten flour oo flour to make neapolitan pizza and others say use hard high gluten bread flower which one is best and why thanks soledad miranda i really don t know but check out the recipe below this man says to use a strong flour i m assuming he means bread flour https youtu be n vrntrbypi mari anne souza yes he is the guy that uses high gluten or bread flour i saw his video first vito uses oo flour which i believe is low gluten flour right now after watching several of these videos i m thinking of trying bread flour with fresh yeast and letting it ferment for 3 days before baking i m looking for a crispier crust thank you for your reply and the link bella pizza that s what i was waiting for thanks who ate such pizza cold water 1500kg of flour must be a mistake because just 1 kg equals 8 cups do you mean 1500 grams maestroo ciao maestro complimenti se devo fare l impasto la sera prima dunque 16 ore di lievitazione con la stessa ricetta quanto levito secco devo mettere grazie ancora its even better if you put dough in the fridge for 2 or 3 days thanks for video really nice can you explain please i wanted to try something like that thanks looks tasty can t wait for the girlfriend to make it u can make it its easy i m not making it for you until you clean the house so first you need a gf cristian rusu that s gonna be tricky stephen devane as long as its not impossible what temperature do you set the oven at how long do you cook the pizza the problem arises because 1500 kg is the equivalent to 12 000 00 us cups according to the conversion calculator on the internet does this seem right to you if he meant 1 5 kg he should have listed that correctly in his posted recipe 1 5 kg is equivalent to 12 us cups of flour sounds more reasonable doesn t it we do not have easy access to kg scales in the us because we do not use the metric system here for most things the cheapest kg scale i could find costs 120 usd this should be taken into account if he s going to promote his videos recipes in the usa unless he doesn t care if we share his videos or recipes with others here in the us what s the point of sharing his videos recipes if they are too difficult for americans to convert makes it pointless doesn t it keep in mind that dry cups as opposed to liquid cups are different measurements in the usa also he might solve the kg dilemma by weighing the flour or converting the flour to us lbs pounds instead of kg this would make it far less complicated for his american viewers to utilize his recipes ok pizza seems delicious but what made me subscribe to your channel is your enthusiasm for your job wanna make amerikan pizza mr indo nyasar v satria jannatan yes i m i liked watching this loved the accent too and the pizza looks great i ll be trying this recipe for sure believe it or not this is very similar to making homemade flour tortillas thank you very much i m going to try this kind regards you say 500grams of flour in the video then 1500kg that doesn t equal out he said use 1kg first then add the 500g with the rest of ingredients after fermentation 7 balls x 250g 1750g consumed 1000g water 1500g flour 5g dry yeast 10g honey or 5g as written 25g salt 50g oil 2590g 1750g 2590g 840g more than three balls missing that s not how you do math on dough satria jannatan of course it s math this is not poetry this is sum of dough ingredients nothing complicated vladimir curcic i said it is math but the wrong way to do it for calculating a dough satria jannatan what is the wrong way to calculate dough the sum of the ingredients and that s it there s nothing to evaporate and disappear it s all there during fermentation only the amount of sugar is reduced slightly which is converted to carbon dioxide beautiful video and obvious skill set you make it look easy bravo vito fantastic congratulation i also love to make pizza in san paolo brasile my grandmother is from rossano calabria and my grandfater is from castelabatti napoli viva italia excellent dough this has become my go to pizza base perfecto can we freeze the dough to use much later than the next day woooowwww for the house uses huge stone oven he explained how you cook it in the house azzorzer no he didn t he never stated what temperature to set the oven al he said was that they were cooking in the brick oven at a little bit lower temperature i had to find the information for temp cooking time in the comments lou kout he said for the house and he is in a house making a pizza i just tried this dough today and it is amazing in shape and taste and it is a very easy process thank u sooo much did you make it with same amount of flour thanks thank you for this vito one question though can i replace the honey for sugar if so i use 5g of sugar too yeah you can dude works the same tom s up for diz ameyzing dow 10 hours is easy fast i we can poot sis onna shit pen i love it toms up what a chad my me pizza pappa vito i tried to follow your pizza dough recipe for the first time and make a pizza for my family today i was very shook cuz it turned out soooo heavenly good and delicious literally everyone couldn t stop devouring the pizza they even ate the crusts though i have one small note about the recipe i followed the exact directions and measurements but still when i mixed 1l of water yeast honey with 1000g of flour the mixture was little bit liquidy so at first i mixed about 1250g of flour till i got a presentable consistency then proof for 1hr then added about 300g of flour and the rest goes as he showed to us it made 11 pizzas of 250g hope that was helpful i m very thankful for sharing this amazing recipe with simple explanations can i freese the dough when i should do it after last rising this is how can you burn pizza pizza that took almost whole day oh yes it s so fast trust me this was fast usually it takes 4 days lol for the bast pizza bravo madona oh man did that look great beautiful but ten hrs until i can finally build my pizza man i just have to be patient eh check out my last video it takes only 2 hours totally worth it the final 6 8 hrs is for building flavour the fermentation of the dough this is the same for any bread you could skip the 6 8 hrs and just go for the texture so long enough for it to double in size 1 2 hrs i use this recipe and alter the time depending on how long i have to spend on the dough joshua lynam i know i know guys i didn t mean to make a harsh remark this video is awesome and actually i made the dough last weekend and yes it is worth the wait vito iacopelli hi vito i just stumbled on your videos and i have to say you are an artist way to go man bravo iacopelli black mosaik bisazza does this freeze well not really sure i m shooting a new video now i know how to make italian pizza thank you grrrreat video thank you boss these commercials are brutal so sorry not sure they go automatically vito great video but some of us are curious what temperature is your room temperature for proofing my dough over proofed by the 5 hour point i still managed to make pizzas from it but the outer crust texture was plastic like texture i made 8 330 320 g dough balls i am going to save the other 4 for a 48 hour cold fermentation and compare thanks for the video just need a little bit more to get over the finish line here in hawaii have the same problem after six hours it s way over proof looks its felt like foam and not like a dough thank you for recipe but we have problem about oven you in your restaurant you have this stone oven the temperature is very higher we in house we don t have this special oven so what is your suggesting for we can get the same result make your oven as hot as possible at least 240c vito does share a good tip in this video cook the base with the tomato sauce first for half the cooking time then add cheese for the second half of the cooking time it should help the base cook more evenly you can add a pizza stone or cast iron pan to your oven to make it hotter get an ooni koda cheap gets to 900 i suggest to use diced tomato not sauce and add olives very nice thank you guy good can you give me the measurements for one small pizza as much as my cat would love to help me finish 6 pizzas i don t think that s a good idea and i prefer my pizza as fresh as possible thanks happy new year you can freeze the dough balls for later use i don t really wanna make that much dough i only want around 4 pizzas max but 1500kg flour is a hell of a lot fantastic recipe just doing it now and preparing some pizzas for this new year s eve i use dry yeast as it is hard to find fresh yeast around my neighborhood thank you so very much best explanation and recipe i found in youtube great videos too you ve got a fan in monterrey mexico greetings from monterrey and happy new year is a real pizza not like others business comercial italian culture best culture change my mind easy and fast ma va fanculo 8hrs to make the dough stroonz hhah i m posting one today that can be ready in 2 hours my friend for a good pizza you need to give time i cant help myself when i see pizza i smile ey vito i really think that your dough in balls after 6 to 8 hours it becoms overfermented so i did in a shorter time and it was a much better dough to work overall a nice recipe thank you hmmmm do you think that is the point to make it over proof a bit daddytokyo aybe it is it depends of how it suits you i just liked it better within a 4 hour fermentation acooc30 i let mine go to 5 hours it was too much i think i was a bit disappointed dont you ever use a pizza rolla cheers from the u k vito mi piace che hai scelto di usare questa canzone e come una bella lullaby mi piace anche sentire il tuo accento e modo di parlare quanto mi manca l italia the only thing that would make this video better is if you show us cutting the pizza into slices then taking a bite so we can enjoy it vicariously through you i have an outdoor pizza oven that reaches over 900 degrees do you have a recipe for pizza dough for a high temperature pizza oven lol he gives good recipe and smart tactics he seems honest guy ciao vito

at pizza it looks delicious ciao vito un saluto da casa tua if have not been here when your in la you must come hello we ve made today pizza on yours recipe we re a little bit sceptic because we have so many pizza recipes on yt but one thing we can tell after meal is that dough was amazing i have never eaten piiza like this it was just perfect we follow the recipe as you shown it was better than in every pizza place in pland and norway where we have eaten regars adrian magdalena thanks hey vito your ingredient list says 1500 kilograms of flour that would be a lot i think you mean 1500 grams 1500 kg would be alot dante ballerini the video itself says 1 5 kg huvs gib yes you are right he does indeed nah 1500 kg is ok you want lots of pizza or not but make sure you scale up the other ingredients too and use you swimming pool since you need to fit about 2 m pizza dough in it p seems weird hearing voila in an italian accent very funny we use it very often you re the best man your videos are so useful thank you pizza yolo gracie e fabulozo how many degrees are cooked in the home oven i d say go as high as you possibly can and if you have one pre heat a pizza stone before putting the pizza on it max temperature if i will use bread flour will i still use the same amount of water and flour as stated in your recipe thanks konjie kuro yes can this recipe be made without kneading like those no knead pizza dough recipes all over the internet thanks maybe in states does work for those the never eat a real pizza but is not the same principally flavour similar is not the same even if looks like who did know the diference however good try thank you i tried but the dough become very sticky what am i doing wrong not enough flower come mi manca la pizza italiana e litalia in generale if you wanted a thicker dough under the toppings not the outside crust is it just a simple matter of not stretching it too thin or is it a total different type of dough that needs to be made i love all styles but usually prefer a slightly thicker chewier pizza thank you i m from willimantic connecticut u s a pizzas mr juliano is pizza if i used egg and milk also for making dough is this good or not please tell me then you have a pizza cake don t use egg and milk that would be better for something like hotdog bun dough thanks for reply i always do this recipe my family love it its so good what flour you use i mean type 405 550 he said one can use all purpose flour meaning 405 will do better is making a 60 40 mixture from 550 405 fyi in the us they don t use numbers like in europe and in many other parts of the world they don t even use the metric system till this very day l accento al mio orecchio mi dice puglia very interesting technique think i was making my dough the traditional wrong way this should be much better dough fantastic very educational thank you if i don t have dry east can i use dry west you sure can you can even use north just don t use south because the south will never rise what leaves did you put on the pizza i m indonesian and live on a small island and have never eaten pizza one day my boss who is italian he gave me challenge to make pizza and i watched your video and tried it for the first time and the result the shape not perfectly round but i ve got excellent from my boss thank you for sharing your knowledge about pizza now someone who used to see pizza on television can make it bravo https youtu be jvxzpttnjyq raffa amen thats not a real pizza not the same dough either would break with a real dough this is not real pizza have to been done without yeast original is with levadura madre the flavour and results are completly diverse this style make a nice pizza but does not real original pizza is only similar becase real original pizza is a poors dish with only strong wheat flour mothet yeast water salt tomato mozzarella basil drop oil stop and the secret for amazing flavour is how and for how many time been levitated is preponderant water quality never yeast powder anecdotic pizza margarita real original pizza without yeast powder been a culinary creation in honor of for this times more than two hundred years ago to margarita di savoia naples and italy empire queen created by raffaele sposito without yeast powder flavor changes doesnt matter what kind of dough you make just respect the rest time burnt pizza i m not sure how he got the salt to mix the way he added it usually you put the salt in the water first melt then add yeast pizziaolos in naples always say everything starts with the water looks great about how long is the cooking process in a traditional pizza oven used by professionals like vito the cooking time for such a pizza would be about 90 seconds your home oven set at its maximum of 500 degrees should cook this particular style of pizza in approximately 8 minutes but ovens vary the faster the pizza is cooked the better it will taste this is why those 8 minute cooked home pizzas usually taste bland the 8 10 minute cooking times work to kill all the flavours of the pizza dough and the fresh ingredients you can get pizzeria style pizzas at home if you cook it on a pizza stone in an outdoor grill where it s possible to reach temperatures of 700 800 degrees honey made yeast happy then pizza happy then the italian happy oil in the dough terrible omg looks amazing thanks which is the name of the music that is playing at 09 18 bravo bees play a vital role in this dough recipe maybe we can get people to care more about the bees if we start saying pizza will cease to exist in 2 years i m surprised you even bothered to get of bed this morning we need bees to make pizza good one it went right over your head it was a dumb joke lies nice my borhter i like the use of honey insted of sugar to feed the yeast but too much use of plastic covering the dough with a thin layer of oil then a damp cloth avoidin touching the dough but not letting draughs of air should work as well best regards from principat d andorra wow cool thanks for sharing gosh it s amazing what can be learned online wrong the plastic wrap is necessary for this fine dough to prevent sticking you don t have to eat the plastic wrap which is an error on your part some damp cloths will leave lint on your dough which you also want to avoid in bakeries you have specialized lint free towels but most home amateur cooks don t have such towels also getting oil on your towels will render them unusable as its hard to clean oily towels properly i would imagine you have many such oily towels in your possession which can also be a health concern adam px and how long has plastic wrap been around and how long has pizza been around toxic and polluting plastic wrap and bowls we can do without and we are better for it as is the planet i say oil it and cover with the towel win win for all adam px i have also hear it s a health concern having plastic wrap touch food google it ganpignanus gianni if you are scared of plastic wrap touching food you are shit out of luck because everything comes packaged to some degree and processed in some unknown location with unknown methods do you know your government even allows a certain level of mouse droppings in processed flours and foods you can t avoid it and when you go outside wear a gas mask because the air you breath is a million times more toxic than food touched by plastic wrap look it up thank you yes sir thank you you have great balls 1500kg of flour even 1500g seems excessive made this dough for the first time a month ago and my family has not stopped demanding more since there are no real pizza places in my town and i can t stomach dominos papa john s or even abbys any more since i ve tasted real pizza talk about a mixed blessing just amazing thank you so much che ci fa lewis hamilton nella tua cucina what s the main reason for proofing the flour in two stages 1kg rest for an hour then 0 5kg and prove for another hour does it make much difference if you used all the flour at the start then let it prove for two hours before rolling the pizza dough balls it is called autolyse the flour gets hydrated from the water and gluten is been build after that you put the rest of the flour and the total kneading time is less if you would have put all the flour once you have to knead it longer to get the same result illi zizon thank you litlbit cox y 1500 kgs of flour isnt that a bit too much or is it 1 5 kg i wish i were half as happy as this guy good for him wonderful the dope best pizza dough i ve seen too much work vito knows what s up this process will create a great pizza thanks for the great recipe question can i freeze the dough after the 6 8 hour proofing at room temp i think its a bad idea you should freeze after letting the dough ball rest about 15 mins you burn it freaking ediot guys i m italian but i love to say voil thanx a lot great sound like borat honey doesnt wanna go into the dough try 10 12 i cant found that video can you link it please thx oh my gosh that looks good i just made a wood fired oven and it is curing afterwards this is what i m going to do liked and subscribed vito what is the name of the wooden bowl to mix the dough and where can i buy one have a link grazie this is basically my recipe sometimes i use honey sometimes sugar i don t measure i just know how it should feel when it comes to dough listen to your gut weigh it gut makes an inconsistent product daddytokyo i totally agree if i owned a pizza place i would definitely weigh everything but for my pizza at home i could careless and i have to say its pretty good happy new year i understand how you feelusually i prepare my food the same way as you preparing it by gut an instinct but when i make stuff for guests that s when things usually fall apart using some malt instead of honey is also a good solution though palease lol michelle meyer thats why all these pizza places suck maybe fucking cooks think they are king dingaling drop the ego montelm4l mann truly no ego at all but i do know good food and the reason they re so many shitty pizza places is because a big percentage people do not have a clue as to what good pizza is very nice why do you use honey and not just regular sugar and with what temperature should i set my oven thank s yum asshole said 10 grams honey but in description wrote 5 gr of honey so it means i made a mistake and i tell you what it don t make that much of a difference have some respect i dont have a stone oven whats the setting if i use an electric one pls try pizzastone or steel hi nice job if i use instant dry yeast how many gramms sould i add for your recipe also what should be the ferment time after i shaoe the dough balls thank you thank you sweet thang you made my day watching you i will definitely try it love me some good pizza pssst i m 68 yrs old but still know a good lookin young man when i see one lol god bless you haha thank you so much

temparature indeed i am teaching myself to do pizzas recently and the cooking is one of the most underated yet most important part of the making 10 mins at 250 and you get a rigid uniform crust 3 min at 400 and you get a crunchy outside soft inside pizza that you can fold in two without breaking it s a world of difference this vid is a bit dishonnest tnk u very mutch perfect pizza question can i

on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside mine is crunchy all the way through pizza pizza pizza pizza smashed the lthumbs up and subscribe button love the videos omg hom many proofing stages i use only 1 5 hours proofing haha eldad mizrachi the longer your proof the more time your dough has to develop flavor 8 10 hours proofing time is the minimum i find for a really good home pizza been

vito you are the man wow nice video vito i m a big fan here is my pizza dough video in german https m youtube com watch v uuqrb 1rm2w weed it s took 8 hours he said easy and first vito iacopelli can you make one with the wheat germ put back in the flour it thank you love the fact you used honey and not refined sugar bravo just awesome please eat this pizza in front of us we want to see the cheese threads s hello from kyrgyzstan dude r u serious 12hrs to make a pizza fuck out i m trying to eat right now not tommorow see people that s an italian not a new yorker tu sei un vero brillante bel video per le panette di pizza non sono da 250g a occhio e croce sono almeno di 350g finally had a homemade pizza crust rise good in my oven like the wet dough followed by the dry dough for getting the yeast to grow and the dough to rise used a kitchen aid pro 5 plus mixer with the power dough hook to do all the mixing and kneading the tips about shaping the dough and pizza were really helpful only need to let the dough rise for 3 4 hr before using used a 550 degree f oven no convection and a pizza screen took 12 min total to cook 18 inch pizza after 7 min for pizza with sauce sprayed crust with oil and added fresh sliced mozzarella and basil tossed in oil and continued for 5 min more then removed from oven and kept pizza on pizza screen elevated to cool for 5 min to keep bottom crispy no sagging slices here great pizza thanks at 550 degree f you can burn it if left in too long so keep an eye on it ow does it not burn at 500 derees nicole crystal he means 500 fahrenheit which are like 250 celsius so it doesnt really burn its just the average highest temperature that home ovens reach nicole crystal actually i use 550 f and yes you can burn it if you leave it in too long how long did you mix the dough and at what speed i ve been putting the cheese on when the pizza is first placed in the oven with my current recipe which is very similar to this recipe and the cooking time is much shorter than yours at around 7 minutes total i have a convection oven but i ve never tried it for pizzas i might give it a try next time neal u using the power dough hook mixed on 2 for 10 min after it formed a compact dough ball or you could take dried leaves and mix it with small stones then mix in i quart of uncooked duck fat then when well mixed put everything in a canvas bag and wrap it with natural twine or coconut fiber rope then place the bag in a 2ft by 2ft hole and cover it with crushed sea shells or lime powder pack it down really good then place a flat rock or patio stone over it gary laco thanks for the mixer information after the 4 hour period for rising did you try placing the extra dough if you had any in the refrigerator to use the next day good results salam jihad lmao hi very nice here s my recipe enjoy https youtu be ew0z67e4t8o i ll will try to make thank you for ur advice vito was awesome enough to provide clarification on the amount of flour it is not 1 500 kg

right now thanks for the arabic translation i got a friend that as a pizzeria tonight i brought me a pizza that was out of this planet normally is nothing special but i was shocked tonight so i decided to watch a video on youtube and i find your good channel and i like to try your way next thanks for your tips question vito is the dry yeast caputo makes anything special and is it something worth buying your videos are awesome for years i tried to make good pizza at home and it s all about the dough after watching your videos i have cracked the code best pizza i ve ever had at home and in most other places i ve even bought pizza i love getting up in the morning to make this dough for the evening was so happy after seeing the results even without a wood fire oven thank you i will never buy dough from the store again made this twice liter of water is too much for 4 cups of water to start with had to tweak the flour and water but you cant expect someone to give you all the secrets i made the exact recipe he gave i mean it s 1 5kg of flour the first kg felt weird but after adding the other 500g of flour and waiting it turned out really good and walla if you use 1500g flour and 1l 1000g and every ball weights 250g shouldn t you get 10 dough balls when you take the dough and put it in the container to dust it in the flour you said you flip it couple times then when you put it in the counter to stretch it you want the face up or it doesn t matter wow perfect dough thanks for sharing always struggle making dough hoping u can see mine too thank you nice video thank you awesome content lovely pizzas ho preparato la ricetta ed uscito alla grande grazie maestro vito sei il migliore saluti dal venezuela dominos is better fast 16 hours making the balls kind gets tricky for me so this would be perfect to make before you go to bed then let it rest in the fridge over night reminds me of borat ali g wa wa we wah lol i will show you how to make a pizza for your home oven here are 7 pizza crust balls we made in about 9 10 hours and we are now going to burn the pizza in a wood burning oven which everyone has at home i forgot what setting do i put my oven to burn the edges for an indefinite amount of time oh and put the pizza in the oven just with sauce to precook like this dump on the pizza all the cheese as well fantastic love pizza key point you put a little bit of flour passion makes the best food thank s for sharing what is the difference between a pizza dough for the house versus one for your pizza oven there at the restaurant wonderful flour 1500 kg the truck is backing up right now i love it thank you question when i let the dough rest for 6 8 hours is it important that i let it rest first in room temperature and only after put it in the fridge for the next day or can i put it straight in the fridge i have the same question vito in other words when it s time for the 6 8 hour room temp rise can we instead put the entire blob of dough in a big bowl covered airtight and bulk ferment it in the fridge for 3 4 days and then make the balls putting them in separate lightly oiled containers when i did the 6 8 hour room temp rise the balls splatted into each other so much you could hardly tell where one began they were almost just one big sheet of dough also it s a lot easier to ball the dough when it is cold and it seems like pulling a ball from the fridge and letting it come to room temperature would give it the rise it needs at least that s been the case for other recipes i ve tried though none had honey olive oil and none were nearly as delicious as yours would this bulk fermentation ball later method work for your recipe thanks food of the gods i like to think i have a varied taste range but homemade pizza is an obsession of mine flour 1500kg excellent video tutorial graci vito super easy and fast my ass hi vito i did everything you said but my crust came out really hard when i expected it to be soft i used a fan oven to cook my pizza i need you help as i don t know what to do next hope you reply yeremiah maybe you had too hot water it s by far the best pizza dough recipe i tried yet did it 3 times already and the dough is always elastic and full of bubbles it s perfect for an incredible margherita pizza dude in beginning looks like a tool willy wonka what does that mean jj tarnoczy look up tool bom pizza obrigado i really can t understand what those 1 5k ppl dislikes about the video the man is literally giving us a free secret amazing recipe thanks a lot for sharing this recipe with us vito they failed at making pizza low iqs ciao maestro i make this dough all the time however i found that 6 hrs is the very limit to proofing 21degrees inside what can i do if it proves too quickly before my guest arrive paul ford put it in the fridge it slows down the proofing process amazing thank you chef you convinced me to subscribe may i know your room temperature but it won t look and taste like that because we don t have those types of ovens in our house he has a video on cooking in a home appliance style oven three ways using a pizza stone or a round pizza pan no holes is better it will if you use a baking steel and your oven will hit 550 leigh logan you are right leave it in for 7 minutes for a soft crust or 9 for a crunchy crust best of luck pizza yolo lol buongiorno vito thank you i did lived in germany and had italian friends always when we wanted to eat pizza went to one of italian restaurant and enjoyed fresh and delicious pizza this guy loves to make pizza how do i become a pizza oyo nice video i used to work in a pizzaria many years ago and love making them will give this a try dry yeast what type idy or ady hello vito first of all i must say to you well done for your hard work all this videos into detail i said i will try your recipe i started and first what happened i did first step as on the video and the dough all purpose flour after mixing by hand become soggy more runny than i see here however is resting now well you might not have time to reply maybe should put 900ml of water anyone find the same thank you if you use the dough that you refrigerated can you use it immediately or do you have to let it sit till it reaches room temperature i would let it sit for about an hour so 10 hrs pizza is the easiest one is that what it means lol 10 hrs i make time to go make money or sleep i can t wait to make 10 hrs pizza thanks so 10 hrs pizza is the easiest one is that what it means lol 10 hrs i make time to go make money or sleep i can t wait to make 10 hrs pizza thanks why is honey and olive oil included when it s not needed or required in vera dough i like that you tell everything even how to keep it for the next day love this im gonna try it thank you i froze most of the dough for 2 weeks and it was still pretty good hi vito i ve got a question can you freeze this dough if you re not going to use it all hi vito buon lavoro keep up the great work i followed this recipe spot on and had the same results at every stage until i made the balls and put them in a sheet pan to rest room temperature was 20c and the dough over proofed within less than 6 hours could you please explain why this occurred thank you for all your work in making these videos for everyone who is passionate about pizza please don t use plastic your ancestors made great pizza without the use of plastic you can also do it plastics wasted like that ends up in landfill and ocean and destroys environment causes pollution and disturbs ecosystem and animals the main thing is the oven think of bbq why is it so delicious the same with pizza you put it in the oven even if you forgotten to put an east during the process or even cheeeese on top you will still end up with tasty food yes with perfect recipe and instructions you may get very good results at home but your pizza will miss the taste of the oven visa interview pizza ki recipe mobile and study and study please banana analysing 2002 ke bikes bahut acchi hai bahut achcha charge achcha dekhna tution story please tried making it total disaster after 7 hours the dough over grew was super sticky and not flexible it torn apart when i tried to stretch it i have experience with dough and i know how to make one with 2 rise times one hour each this 8 hour version did not work well and tasted too sour maybe i put too much yeast that s the only thing i can think off beside the recipe being bad daniel you might try cold fermenting the entire big blob of dough for at least 3 days and use 00 flour then ball it up about 250 grams per ball it s much much easier to ball when it s cold and put each ball in an olive oiled airtight deli container return balls to the fridge when ready to make a pizza remove a ball from fridge several hours in advance let it rise and get to room temperature 78f is about perfect while still covered in the deli container and then stretch it out and make your pizza i make mine on top of parchment paper which is on top of my peel then i launch the pizza on the parchment paper onto a baking steel a pizza stone has never worked for me at 500 550f the crust will be cooked enough after 2 3 minutes so that you can lift it up and pull out the paper leaving the pizza directly on the steel or just leave it on the parchment paper for the entire cook works for me every time just be sure to get top knotch parchment or it will burn and disintegrate i ve tried numerous neopolitan dough recipes and vito s is the best hands down yes the balls get very blobby and run together if you proof them together for 8 10 hours but if you do your balling after a 3 5 day bulk ferment while the dough is cold it s easy leigh logan thanks maybe i ll try it once i get over my disappointment daniel shtrum tsipin i just tried it last week kneaded entire blob put it in a huge bowl tightly covered and refrigerated for 4 days got a huge rise in the bowl maybe b c used saf instant active yeast balled when cold all came out great easy to stretch great crust good luck i used gluten free flour while making this and it was a total and absolute fail of course you need the gluten in the dough to make it stretchy and smooth xd making those dough balls is not easy i know because i ve tried so many times and it requires skill acquired from years of practice thumbs up for the authenticity and craftsmanship demonstrated here rather than the commercial mass produced and lifeless pizza that s taken over the market you say 10gr honey in the video but it says 5gr honey in the description which is more right and does it matter just like it to be perfect excellent video btw don t listen to him all restaurants won t tell you the true recipes for their dishes try it at home you won t get the same taste as they do i think to much technique how to make a pizza dough litte hole into middle dough yummy yummy very delicious thanks and this would be the moment i realize i ve been making pizza dough totally wrong my whole life that sound and chi mi frena always plays in my head whenever i make anything italian 8 33 love how he says easy and fast whole thing takes 8 10 hours heck that s not the tragedy mentioning the wood oven was gotta go and build a wood oven it s pretty fast to me the least amount of time i m used to letting pizza sit is roughly 24hrs you can make in morning have it ready for night put them in fridge refrigerator or freezer did he say i am a professional pizza yolo haha its pizzaiolo its basically a person that makes pizza making pizzas with completely white cloth yea this guy is brave cool i try to make it the dough you don t use do you put it in the fridge or freezer big hug from argentina refrigerator also you don t have to do a warm table rise if you don t want i actually let my dough rise slowly in the refrigerator over several days it develops more flavor and allows me to use the dough over the course of a week if you make a batch of dough as large as he does you might want to do that people aren t going to make seven pizzas over the course of 2 days 77macgruber excellent thank you mac oh the proper pizza thanks for sharing i ll try it tonight yummy can you please share the result yep it s was good best one i ve made so far my husband said the same but i didn t rise it for six hours three so i think the longer

it doesnt affect as much thanks in advance am in the uk baking is all about time given to dough to rise and relax and type of oven plays an important role as well aima eyo thanks again sorry for

hahaha halos chef i need rosetta sos pizza plisse how to burn a pizza this is a dream come true for me to find and subscribe to a professional pizzeria cooks channel fran ais svp burned pizza i did it today i succeded with more flour 2 3 cup more than the 1 5 kg suggested by mr iacopelli when posting a video on the net be sure you have you get it right please pepe lepew makes a nice pizza to long 6 to 8 hours merci i like it when you slap it i did exactly what you ve done on your video and not good are you for real or are you trolling too much water for the amount of flower next time 3 4 lit instead of 1 lit flower hehe he adds a lot more after the rise manchild the rapper he said and wrote 1 5 kg so i did flour je parle fran ais j adore i ll try to make it your way looks grear i added 1 liter of water to the 1kg of flour and it was soupy pancake batter consistency what did i do wrong how can these proportions be right i had to add a ton more flour it should be about 1 5 1 6 kg of flour i think i responded to your comment in more detail somewhere else i realize what you did though you re supposed to only add 1kg for the first part and you add the remaining 500 600 grams after the first mixture watch the video closely and listen at 2 50 in vas por thanks for your help but i googled 1 kg and originally came up with 4 cups flour and it should have been 8 cups so i had only half the flour needed that was my mistake luke smith ah that makes sense lol glad you figured it out good luck i made dough twice already the first time i messed up cause i thought i let it ferment too long so i threw it out but the 2nd time came out very well the dough will have a bit of a beer smell thats just part of the process of the yeast fermenting so don t worry if you notice that good luck btw i see the 4 cups thing too i dunno why it s listed like that but i would use grams i used a scale 1kg 1000 grams basically thats very strange about the 4 cups misinformation hello vito thank you for great videos i have a question can i use this recipe and leave doug for couple of days in cold like a 72h fermentation or should i change recipe i made it perfect mines looks even better thayn

balisimo vito i want to come work in your shop yo why you playing that song guess i will have to spend 20 00 on metric measurer hej vito hope you see this i used your recipe in my pizzeria and now people love my pizza thank you god bless you keep up the good work wish you all the best bravoo stupid chef im hungery black pizza tried this recipe in half i think i did ok so far best dough i ve made hi vito love the channel where can i buy the wood dough mixing box you use valla when ure new making this i wouldnt try so making so much dough kindly tell me the recipe of dough in spoons n cups measurements thanks looks ok but i ll take new york pizza every time the best dough and pizza there is bravo tanti aguri ahaha pizza for life is it 5 grams or 10 grams of honey video says 10 bbertrand007 it s just to insure the yeast is active so as long as u have fresh recently bought dry yeast u could just skip it altogether but if you re curious just add 7 grams lol it won t change anything enjoy your pizza go to 1 59 for the recipe something tells me this isn t the first time this guy has done this excellent no he did it for the first time too he was watching some youtube tutorials beforehand grazie per la buona pizza sei grande complimenti he likes spanking the dough who the fuck wants to wait 8 hours to eat pizza man nice bro the artist beautiful pizzaiolo yummy you are a master chef whom digs deep into his roots vito is amazing everyone needs this video instructions for home made pizza pizza is always my favorite cuisine i don t want to make more than about 2 pizzas for any one meal and would not likely eat pizza more than twice a month and don t want to freeze any excess so vito you need to shrink this recipe down to make only 2 pizza balls and you need to put it in american cooking terms by using cups and teaspoons and tablespoons not liters and grams and i don t really care for ounces i don t want to have to weigh anything on a scale i don t really want pizza dough creation to become some kind of chemistry experiment i want to quickly throw a few things in a mixer and be done with it can t a 2 dough ball recipe be estimated into something like 1 cup water 1 4 tsp yeast 1 2 tsp honey or sugar 1 2 tsp salt 1 tbsp olive oil and 1 1 3 cups flour for example i mean how much different would that dough be now we wouldn t want to end up with something like 85 cups water 20 tsp yeast 47 tsp honey 39 tsp salt 78 tbsp olive oil and 1 32 cups flour for example that would be just as difficult to measure oh and i once tried to make pizza sauce using canned san marzano tomatoes and a few ingredients similar to yours and it was totally flavorless i mean i typically just use pizza sauce out of a small jar such as prego pizza sauce and that tastes pretty damn good to me and here in america we typically like to put a bunch more shit on our pizzas like pepperoni and fresh mushrooms etc not just 3 leaves of basil i feel sorry for the group that might share this pizza some people get a fraction of a basil leaf some get cheese some get only sauce some get only crust i want all that shit in every damn bite plus pepperoni mushrooms black olives etc no he doesn t you just need to use some basic math and maybe google the conversion from metric to american units every hobo with a double digit iq can do that harald lohoff maybe if you gave a shit and actually ever made a pizza dough you might know what i m talking about i did do it prior and if you assume he came up with 10 dough balls which we don t know for sure if it s 9 or 10 you end up with 422675 of a cup of water per ball or 3 3814 ounces of water real useful that s why i figure things need to be rounded to a more american measure and proportion hence pretty much 1 2 cup of water per ball or 1 cup for 2 balls vito will only benefit by being able to make another video which i m sure he or his followers won t mind at all i ll make my rounded measure dough sometime and likely find that it turns out pretty damn good perhaps indistinguishable from vito s for most lay people who knows maybe better 1 2 day for pizza btw thx for recipie perfeita verry good lg waldfee christine that was cool hey vito can i use caputo 00 all purpose flour in this recipe thanks in advance the water is warm or luke warm or just normal temperature water room temperature thank you maestro mille grazie very easy to understand and remember you re the best your great making pizza dough where jesus was put when he was born i like it the first variant with fresh yeast does not have the prefermentation stage and two fermentation stages before the big one at the end only one also there you mix all water yeast salt and olive oil from the begining here you do this in two stages also adding the honey the water hydration is a bit different as well why is such a difference it is because using the dry vs fresh yeast and the technique is different thanks i have tried doing this recipe and it came up really bad it seemed like i ve put too much water but my measurements were perfect can i get any help ofek knead in more flour a little at a time it should not be stiff loose and stretchy yes add less oil y use a veg oil instead the olive oil makes a softer dough ofek depends were you live and were the flour is what brand what type thank you very much i will try using a different type of flour you are awesome thanks you perfect omg my mouth is watering great video i ve never seen a mixing box made of wood so cool con 500ml di acqua le dosi vanno semplicemente dimezzate o cambiano completamente dopo l impastatura ho lasciato lievitare per circa 2 5 ore va bene lo stesso o poi devo ridurre i tempi dopo la stagliatura grazie valter very good pizza i ended up with 10 dough balls i made a pizza before waiting the 6 hours and it still turned out pretty good the ones that i made after the 6 hours were much bigger bubblier though me too mine made 10 balls i used a scale and they all were 250g lynne c hartley is the recipe suppose to be 5g or 10g of honey alex i guess it is not vital the exact amount of honey a very little amount just to activate the yeast lynne c hartley i took a screen grab of the list of ingredients at beginning and it says 10 grams honey which i used w no problems can you freeze it if you want alot of air bubbels in your pizza the 6 hours rest is important also be gentle with the dough because you dont want to press the air out like your pizza recipe i am not able to eat tomato sauce what kind of sauce mixture can i use is it necessary to have a sauce on pizza i don t want it to taste dry maybe vegetables like bell pepper and some meats are enough irene k i spread minced garlic and then sprinkle oregano thyme and rosemary on the base of my pizzas very moist and super flavoursome good job wow man thanks do you use active dry yeast or instant dry yeast in this recipe it s dry yeast dry you can see further info on the description very good si prega di scrivere la ricetta in turco it seems fucking deliciousss great wooden container thanks for the receipe great job love it please amout of water about please

mushrooms and you got real pizza why do i get the impression that this guy is impersonating an italian accent to come off as authentic excellent awesome thank you easy maybe but faster i don t think so it took him half a day to prepare the dough when adding sugar to the dough it will be faster ready but it will change the texture and taste of your dough cant stretch pizza like u the dough stretch

un mito i love your videos and your channel but this recipe did not turn out well for me i used 00 flour and a pizza stone heated for an hour but the crust was dense and chewy and it took forever to cook after even 20 minutes at 500 degrees the dough was still pale and soft i have never gotten an excellent result with homemade dough but i have had better results than this with other recipes in this ofen is not problem pizza perfect in the home ofen is problem voila guuuyyce 1 37 a dry east yup i wondered yeat or east aima eyo he spells is correct though but keeps pronouncing it dry east and every time he says it with emphasis like dry east lol omid h i am not a native speaker you mean that y is silent in yeast but weird east is yeat haha i liked the pizza though la pizza e bruciata io non la mangerei wow sau lecker i think pizza looks great so didn t some others they all have different dough rest n rise time from 2 30 minutes next guy 2 hours and this guy up to 10 hours i realize dough is sensitive but i don t get why the hours are so different and the pizza all look the same texture of cook dough at the end they all look awesome anybody can answer that loved this entertaining helpful video we ve been making pizza for many years and yours looks very intriguing delicious so next week we try your recipe thank you god bless you the dry yeast you use is it active of instant is the amount of yeast the same if you use instant or active dry yeast thanks nice does it matter where the top of the ball goes in the pizza should it be up or down or does that not matter thank you so much wow gino less the excruciating innuendo that pizza looked fantastico now i definitely know i m doing it all wrong voila bitch i was like 1 5 kg so i sed ogh it not for 1 pizza douuu the tomato sauce do i uave to cook before using it for pizza making help too bad that pizza fresh out of the oven doesn t look anywhere near as good as you while commercial neapolitan kitchens invariably use them nonetheless i m not a fan of baking with such high heat pizzeria s use those absurdly hot ovens 600 900 f solely so they can crank out a pizza each minute is our goal glazing clay pottery smelting down reclaimed precious metals or baking an authentic italian style pizza personally i prefer quality over quantity and home cooking versus a commercial production line pizza baked at 425 f for 10 12 minutes yields a vastly superior final presentation versus something that was cruelly and brutally cremated while still alive for the sake of maximal speed and profit but enough of the critique and now for some praise which was earned and is due thanks for so generously sharing your lifelong culinary experience and knowledge for so many to enjoy you re extraordinarily charming good

to not look like a sponge you can keep experimenting adding stuff while working the dough the only right thing he did was activating the yeast you also don t have to let it sit that long one hour total outside in room temperature is fine to grow the dough can i add salt in the water instead of adding it to the raw dough no salt kills the yeast if you put this way was looking for a video with

somehow bello video solo che non si capische un cazzo non poi parlare anche italiano 1500kg of flour seems a bit excessive i have been making pizza for 4 years now but i have never seen such a great dough thank u so much for this video approximately at what temperature should the oven be set thank you for the clear instructions if you use a conventional oven it is best to set the temperature to maximum u hv burned the pizza bro easy and fast thank you for a great recipe i have made pizzas twice using your recipe and they have been the best pizzas i have ever made i used a bit of sugar instead of honey as i don t like honey and so don t keep any in my house but the recipe worked perfectly with sugar what type of yeast did you use lovely lecture looks beautiful and easy to make thanks dearie okay but how many flour and the other ingredients i need if i only wanted to make likw 2 oe 3 doughs you half or split the amount accordingly for example 1 5 kilos of flour for 6 pizzas 0 5 kilos for 2 pizzas tip use your bbq which gets way hotter than your oven grazie mile from mexico making this today i am stuck on band aid brand cause germ don t stick on me no glove no love what does this moronic comment have to do with the video we d all love to know why you waste our time did anyone else get a pizza hut ad in the middle grazie vito you dough really sucks man i am not even italian but i know for sure thats not the way you have to treat a pizza dough i mean did everyone watch that burned edges perfect pizza good job man hes absolutely right about putting the dough in with the sauce first about 5 minutes but i found if you put stones on the bottom rack and the middle rack and cook the pizza on the bottom rack with the oven on 500 degrees it will all cook at the right pace also get a pizza screen so you can easily put your pizza on the hot stone you don t need a fancy pizza stone get 12 6 6 inch equarry brick tiles 6 on one rack 6 on the other other do not use glazed tile or you will poison yourself two pizza racks for 12 good luck big difference when you use bread flour do not use all purpose flour or your pizza comes out dense you must use bread flour similar to 00 great recipe so basically a hard flour with 11 14 protein azerbaijan thanks vito for sharing if your going to learn how to make a pizza pie best to learn from a true italian 1500kg

my us measurements specifically the flour thank you beautiful i cannot wait to try it thank you for every thing and translations nice recipe of how to make italian pizza indeed all dough what i saw to make the time is very important don t like to wait but the fermentation is the key in spanish translation section where sayd yeast seco bueno yeast es levadura para los hispanos parlantes greetings from rosario santa fe argentina great recipe firstly nothing wrong with dry yeast it s totally fine if you can t measure the yeast weight too low 2 teaspoons for 1 5kg flour should be fine exact yeast amount is really not important specially with his very long proofing time no need to add honey or sugar imho the most important part of making pizza is the oven home oven do only up to 250 c commercial ovens do 350 c or more of course his wood oven is very nice but it needs a few hours to get started if you love pizza get a g3 ferrari type pizzaoven or a copy of but look for one that goes over 300 c to jest zajebisye vito maestro molte grazie recepte is buonnoo arivederchi from bella croatia sory i dont no speking italiano but i hope you understanding to me iaoo amici mieii did not work for me how do you get that puffy crust mine is flat home plz tell oven temp n time by the way he is wrong about the metal bowl for any active yeast it doesn t like metal it oxidizes so a wood glass or ceramic bowl is preferred depending on the size of your dough metal will react with the yeast and it won t be quite the same i always use metal bowls same type that we saw in this video actually been doing it for 8 years now so far i haven t ever noticed any issue i do pizza dough rye bread sourdough ect the dough has always risen so i don t know rattmaster86 i didn t explain myself well the metal bowl is better if you re trying to contain the dough some slower yeasts like sourdough might do better usually for a sourdough you don t salt as much but you do a longer rise so a metal bowl would serve to make it more flavourful as the yeast would fight more this man is the most italian person who has ever lived great explanation i have been watching your videos for a while now and i like them as you keep attention to details i m baking pizzas on the granite stone placed on the top shelf just under electric grill pizza always come out lovely i found that freshly made and used on the same day dought rise better than the one rested in the chill or pre frozen have been also making with sourdough great stuff had provo last year with my family it was absolutely amazing thanks for being for nice vito hai fatto un disastro pizza bruciata su due lati c era aria nel l impasto i like it when he throws the empty bowls away who is going to clean the mess very easy and great flavor thanks from mexico i have same problem over and over i can t stop when dough is still so sticky but by looking it is obviously when you stop to have right hydratation value and flexibility of dough lets cook with swing https open spotify com playlist 5yvdikgr5xhktlbo2eplhj si n gaphroqtgr9eqoua6ajg you showed us how to make six pizza s at home one would be enough thank you for sharing we love pizza viva italia your work speaks for itself good job you talk too much fucking american thats a lot of dough amount for s home i think he meant enough pizza dough to fill up a home why use honey honey have antimicrobial property while you re trying to create bacteria for fermentation use sugar honey ma t sient buon vatt rtrt v why ohhhh why a liquid measurement in weight or is it just to be f irritating my local market has fresh premade pizza dough for 1 29 i love how he said we made it together easy and fast 12 hours is not my definition of fast the pizza looks delicious though tempreture of the oven while cooking no i won t forget to don s up this video appeared as a some pizza topic next video and i noticed that i hate you since you threw the pineapple pizza even if it was a bed experience i also do not like you must not did that it was also such a disrespectful behavior towards your pizza maker colleagues and their efforts what kind of yeast do they use to do the dough at a restaurant hardest way to make pizza on youtube mental amount of time 10 hours is a bit short much better flavour is achieved with an 18 hour final prove at a controlled temperature of 13 c you can t rush these things it also helps to use a slow prove flour as the enzyme production is better regulated pizza should have one appeared better it does not help to be tasty it should also please our eyes

pizza on top of foil and bake dough thanx for ur hard work question why do u only autolyse half of the flour instead of all of the flour wouldnt that mean that only half of the flour was properly hydrated autolysed the 2nd half of the flour was not autolysed at all anybody knowledgable please reply soon my measuring cups ar made in the usa are marked for cups s not grams etc good vito dove posso comprare un bel forno di pizza qui a los ngeles i have tried the recipe twice now but dough balls get over fermented i can reform the dough ball and i am good to go in 20 mins what am i doing wrong still the most airiest pizza crust i have been able to make on my own thought i was a mastetchef by now but i couldnt get the dough from the table anymore after adding topping rip pizza only a master chef knows that he must sprinkle the work surface with flour a v k that was not the problem after looking back to the video he sprinkles the dough before flattening also and i didnt xd i like how this is just a straight forward non pretentious video now that s a lot more what a pizza crust should look like than wha you usually see nowadays it reminds me of what my calabrese relatives used to bake in their bronx pizzeria i make mine on a pizza stone in a grill i can get the grill up to 650 fahrenheit just made 7 yah easy but not fast 00 06 a professional pizzaiolo since the age of 8 this is what happens when humans begin to take themselves too seriously thanks for the recipe tanks thank you vito your pizza looks delicious excellent merci anyone know what the purpose of the wooden box is thats alot of dough is there any point in the process that the dough can be freezed for longer storage sourdough is much better than dry yeast and more healthy but making sourdough takes two weeks and you still have to hope it works a v k it takes 2 weeks to get up running the first time if you ve never done it before after that you can use it every day i have just ordered a pizza thank you for a really good tutorial and tips i love a crispy crust that pizza looks so good mi piaci l opera i will definitely try baking just the crust and the sauce for a few minutes first the next time i make pizza my oven only goes up to 550f 290c i ve been really enjoying the pizza that comes out but i want the crust darker and the cheese cooked less dry east thank you wow thank you how do we proportion it if only making 2 doughs since the 1 5 kg flour makes 8 doighs and we wont be able to use all of them in a day or two divide the recipe in 4 when you put the dough back in the fridge do you leave it out for 6 hours again great videos subscribed for more abu chowdhury no not usually most people prefer to leave the dough to rest or relax for 5 to 10 minutes after taking it out of the fridge again some people prefer to let the dough sit until it s room temperature again all the pizza s recipes won t come right unless you have the perfect oven unfortunately grazie a te per la tua pizza et per il tuo buon umore viva la buona pizza fast bug in the yeast at 1 45 feels good after that shitty got season 8 lol hello vito can you answer me a straight question please will adding oil or butter on the pizza edge of dough or half way baked to the crust will make it crispy or soggy fat should make it fluffy but not crispy do you agree thanks you shouldnt handle food with an open wound however small it may be next time you are wearing a bandaid wear rubber gloves on that hand who needs cheese on their pizza you kinda sound like the russian hacker but you re not russian so that

film like i said they formed good pizza but was impossible to keep the outer skin on the balls any ideas alexzander thanks i did have some left over dough balls i put in the fridge overnight and the were better to work with love your cooking the pizza looks fantastic thanks for share with us your time and experiency thanks lot yummy you gotta eat it too that s the money shot i like this chef

quando bambina in italia griazie mille per aver postato questo video con la ricetta usando lievito secco qui in america non facile incotrare il lievito fresco adesso ho anche imparata non si usa tutta la farina al principio e che si aggiunge il sale e l olio dopo il primo crescito e che invece il zucchero tu ci sei messo il miele puro che maraviglia di venire a imparare tutto questo sono cos felice di aver trovato il tuo video qui su youtube grazie mille vito non vedo l ora di provare di fare questa pizza da sola prego che mi riesce proprio come la tua jajaja vito o una domanda e non so si t rispondi le domande qui sopra mia domanda si posso congelare il resto dell impasto che non uso o posso tagliare a la met gli ingredienti se troppo da per il momento grazie ciao vito half recipe in standard i m doing 5 cups flour to 2 cups water 2 teaspoons yeast and 2 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon honey 1 tablespoon oil can add 1 teaspoon extra oil makes 4 12 inch pizzas they key to a great crust is not to de gas it before cooking notice how carefull he is taking it out of the cookie sheet i have researched many recipes from youtube and this one is my favorite very close to wolfgang pucks anyone here watching this from chicago so aside from making my own are any pizzeria in chicago that make pizza like this how is 10 hours easy and fast bravo le doy un threeee vito seriously mastered the dough here order of ingredients over time and fermentation are on point ciao vito greetings from austria thanks a lot for that video great instructions easy to follow one question is it possible to freeze the dough and use afterwards if so would you freeze it after the 8 hours rising phase or before i wanted to make half the amount so i have put half kilo flour 00 type with half litre water and it is very wet dough like cake mix not like in the video you were a professional since you were 8 years old how long do you pre cook the dough with tomatoe and also can you freeze the uncook dough thanks a part du fromage et une minuscule couche de tomate il y a rien dave to add honey have you thought of using natural yeast sourdough can farina flour be used for italian sourdough and have you thought of using cornmeal for sliding this guy been making pizza since he s 8 y o i can t think of a more worthy life pursuit i tried his recipe and the flavour of the dough is significantly better other recipes which call for more yeast and less flour the most common ratio is 7g yeast for 500g flour if you plan ahead use his recipe then you ll have the best pizza for sure dont havva mixer thank you vito holy shit that dough recipe is fantastic waited a long time to get it right and you nailed it wow i cant thank you enough for this recipe it truly is amazing i followed it to the tee don t have to crave nyc pizza anymore thanks to you my family and friends loved it as well regards rene sarasota florida usa can t bear to watch fake accent gracias vito ya estoy preparando la m a oye crees

fine pizza thanks for sharing nice video two dommps up from me top holy shit that s a lot of salt kriste isopahkala actually it s not because for every 500g you use 10g then 25g salt for 1 5kg flour is quite normal other wise the dough taste very bland indeed emmm yummy vito once you busted out that pizza box i knew you were the real deal for my confused american friends who may be reading the recipe in the description it s 1 5kg flour not 1500kg that is equal to 1500 grams instead of 3306 pounds of flour i also halved the recipe this time with great success jbaby007 thank you you just saved me lots of time very gud tnx alot i am from modena italy i love your accent and the dough looks great thank you mmmm i will marry you now you will make this pizza every night ok i can give u my

approximately 10 hrs the dough had a lot air pockets extremely sticky metric assure a contant and permanent result great video i love it when you take something thats considered junk food and add the old values passion and care and out comes awesome food i have had good pizza results using simular method while also adding 15 20 durum flour of the total flour what is that last song which starts at about 10 23 delicious the best pizza i ever eat pyszna najlepsza pizza jaka w zyciu jadlem all that work just to burn the shit out of it no meatballs pepperoni mushrooms onions green peppers sausage or jalape os that s just burnt cheese bread what did he say his profession was pizza yolo chris varela pizzaiolo in italian means pizza maker the best pizza dough i ve ever seen this guy knows what he s doing compare this chef with sam the cooking guy why why would you need to compare them very good pizza very well channel can i freeze the rest or is not going to be good thanks for the video fratelo yes you can freeze it i read it s advised to freeze before the 3rd rise or you can make ready to bake frozen pizzas by assembling your pizza ahead of time the dough lasts about 1 week in the fridge olive oil is the obvious oil to use but in fact sunflower oil works best in my experience although i have quibbles with the recipe the method of making the dough looks correct and the results look excellent fake news it is old wives tale that dry yeast needs to be activated by water or hot water or fed sugar yeast eats the carbs in flour and gets all the water it needs to spring back to life when you simply mix it room temp or even chilled water works perfectly fine next time you make dough mix the yeast with the salt and flour add water and it goes also flour does matter while you ll certainly get a crust with all purpose flour order a bag of caputo blue sack tipo 00 flour off the internet it will have at least a bit of blue on the sack it gives night and day different results even the difference between caputo s blue sack and red sack varieties is amazing even though they re both finely ground high protein bread flours i think i prefer blue but red is a lot easier to work with when you get past 70g of water per 100g flour although i have quibbles with the recipe the method of making the dough looks correct and the results look excellent lqr824 tranquilo viejo si el italiano dice que se prepara as es porque le resulta as yea thanks for the recipe now let me go cook my great dough in my shit oven cuz you know i decided not to use my restaurant based hot box specially made for pizzas thanks a simple trick to fix that problem i took a cookie sheet one of those aluminum rectangle pans and flipped it over then i covered the top with aluminum foil i guess you don t have to do that but it worked for me the preheat your pan in your oven at 500 degrees fahrenheit i prepared my pizza on a cutting board covered with parchment paper and a generous sprinkle of flour on top since i don t use corn meal this made it easy to slide the prepared pizza off of my cutting board and onto my preheated pan in the oven i baked it for about 10 minutes it s just as good i hope this helps jbaby007 i ve been wanting to try this recipe is it safe to place parchment paper on a 500 degree oven did you placed the pizza on the upper or lower rack i would really appreciate your response beautiful pizza only 19 hours to make the dough it really is fast my dough balls rose a lot they turned themselves into one massive cake what did i do wrong thank you a great refresher i learned to make real pizza in florence the cross or crust crust i m sorry for my spelling vito iacopelli just kidding vito great pizza presentation thank you so much love the recipe can you do a pizza bianca video private sexy video 18 http ptd8hhnnz5 imobil design dynkp1edxa do you really speak like that in real life he is italian you should shut your mouth if you don t know even that much that there is an accent for every non american country you fucking oaf dough plastic used ratio seems way to much i used your recipe to make pizza dough for the first time i did add italian seasoning for extra flavor but it turned out great i was using a ilfornino f series woodfiredoven when the oven has reached the temperature to get hot inside then i put in my dough which i have placed over a circle of parchment paper it works perfectly it cooks well on the bottom and it doesn t stick to the base yummy this a joke that pizza was burnt bro what you ve never had actual good pizza i guess yes yes yes yes yes en italiano my dough for the first rise was really wet i had to add more flour i m really disappointed hopefully it turns out and tastes ok did it work jbaby007 did it work yes it worked out just fine i added enough flour until it looked like a good consistency compared to his in the video the dough also rose a lot more than what he had maybe due to excess yeast or the hawaiian heat but either way i had 7 pizza dough balls which i kept in the fridge all week and made pizza throughout the week using food wishes pizza sauce recipe i considered freezing some but i had already reached the second rise at that point however this dough would be great to make a frozen ready to bake everyone loved it pizza cooked for 10 minutes at 500 degrees fahrenheit in my oven i made a pizza stone using a baking sheet that i flipped over covered the bottom in foil and let that pan preheat in the oven for 10 minutes i shaped my dough on a cutting board covered with parchment paper with a generous dusting of flour on top to prevent the dough from sticking while assembling my pizza then i slid the pizza off on to the preheated pan in the oven and baked for 10 minutes or until the cheese was slightly golden oops immaculate ohh gosh too long a procedure but immediate thanx whats worse we use active yeast what a jerk lol this jerk is supporting a huge rent comebto new haven ct we make dough every day the appiza is great no you don t prove it me hey babe smiling i going to make you a pizza babe oh yes i am starving me just give me 10 hours and it ll be ready babe stares at me and

excelent recipe vito thanks a lot take that stupid pizza and shove it in your mouth can you freeze the dough 5 5 25 50 goat pizza it is then jason scott you sick you need help yes easy and fast only took 10 hours xd on the 10h how much time does he spent working on the dough very few and that s something you have to understand when you re making pizzas or bread you will not do the main work but the yeast and the rest time will you only have to organize your work such way it suits you make your dough the day before let it rest for the night and you ll have your pizza for the lunch i m not pizza olo and i don t know how to make pizza s dough but as baker i can tell you this guy perfectly knows what he s doing because he respects the rest time and the own working of the dough souvarine you should grow a sense of humor i bet it would make your job as a baker more fun and give a whole different aspect of life peace nihliztic wait this was supposed to be funny then i return you the advice calm your tits souvarine he she just joking are you a fucking italian many italian take food topic too seriously like hell your rage over a cooking joke looks so cringe claro que puedes hacerla en un proceso directo es decir sin fernentar tanto tiempo para tener tu pizza en hora y media pero la consistencia y el sabor del pan no ser el mismo la fermentaci n larga dara mejores resultados en crocancia textura y sabor de hecho hay procesos a 12 24 y 48 horas pero solo expertos en fermentaciones controladas son capaces de hacerlas as como vito saludos desde m xico amigos mr apriza yutama even worse than italian we guillotined for less es claro que esta receta es de una pizza profesional si quieres algo r pido y com n pide una a domicilio y listo pereza resuelta ecksdee xd souvarine 100 correct rest time is the secret vito is a gem souvarine i like that you missed the joke and spent so much time on a reply hey don vito corleone i like ur video souvarine thank you for explaining it helped me lulu channel i m glad that i could help you do you believe italian mafia you don t need to stand in front of the dough for ten hours make the dough the day before genius yes taking the time to do things correctly is such a waste of time eh the only long part is letting the rough rest for 6 8 hours the rest is pretty simple and quick once you understand the process yeah shame you can t pull up to taco bell drive thru and have them hand you the dough in 3 minutes lot of sensative people not seeing how the response is defensive and he s not taking a joke he s politely sharing the process the longer the dough rests the lighter it is to digest it it contains many good bacteria then you should grow a sense of brains the work is easy how hard is to wait go and study something wanted to like but you are on 420 couldn t do it his oven temp is still way higher than at home on conventional tho my conventional would never toast like that even at max heat of 475 mr apriza yutama you re the one who is exhibiting rage shut up nihliztic hhahahahaahhahahaah hello vito really appreciate your channel and trying to learn from it i think you do a great job but one question in the above video you added 1500 gms of flour 1000 gms of water and 50 gms olive oil which totals 2550 gms so how did you end up making just 7 balls of 250 gms each because it only adds upto 1750 gms where is the remaining balance weight of 800 gms please explain lol bellissimo lavoro sei un grande pizzaiolo un saluto dall italia ha ha ha i was thinking that too i thought he said quick and easy lol looks good though and he seems so sweet at first i thought it was an american putting on a fake italian accent pizza is always better when you have a wood fed 800 degree oven nice looking pizza thank you so much vito i m so happy to discover your channel i finnaly understand what s wrong with all the recipes i ve been trying you re my hero why honey not sugar after watching your pizza dough recipe i have a question about why your sides have burnt to make pizza dough is very simple no need to put dough for long hours just add the following ingredients give a quality good dough results 1 warm water 2 butter or migraine non salted one if salted one then adds less salt 3 all purpose flour 4 suger 5 egg 6 dry yiest 7 dry powder 8 oil if used olive oil will give your better test in eating also the pizza little bit soft other used cooking oil 9 milk the last thing i want you that beat eggs and milk and brush the edge of your pizza dough so the oven will not burn the edges if someone needs my recipe then let me know i am will share a short video for you guys sure that will be great thanks the total amount in weight for this recipe is 2585 grams this would give 10 34 pizzaballs for 250 grams each if i divide everything with 10 34 you get these amount per pizza ball flour 145 06 gram water 96 71 gram yeast 0 48 gram salt 2 41 gram olive oil 4 83 gram honey 0 48 gram youre the mvp sorry but honey is about 1 gr per pizzaball yep because i have a 400 degree wood fire oven in my kitchen easy and fast i don t think 14 hours for dough is fast and the ingredients should have been scaled down a lot it looked like this recipe made 8 10 balls of dough way too much for the average household it was stated that unused dough could be refrigerated and used the next day but no instructions on how to freeze unused dough for future use if not using the next day you can use proportions i did and it was quite successful then you do can freeze it for any long and unfreeze it at best naturally or in a microwave at 15 c 24 c yeast gets its effect back thank you vito i can honestly say that your videos have tought me how to make some amazing pizzas pizza night in our house is

utilissimi consigli uso la ricetta di questo video e funziona alla perfezione ho giusto una domanda di curiosita la prima lievitazioni con pari peso di acqua e farina a cosa serve esattamente per attivare meglio il lievito grazie mille hello vito in the first fermentation part my dough is very watery do you think that the floor i use needs less water than what your recipe needs i divided the recipe by 3 so i used 500g flour and 330l water yes mario i tried this way and works better water should be 60 of the flour weight so for 1kg of flour it should be 600ml of water goredm ok thank you very much your recipe is the best by far luv you thank you we like it i will try thank you for writing the ingredients down below in many languages this shows your respect for your audience i really appreciate it i speak arabic as a mother tongue if i don t have a stone can i put it in a pan to precook it and then finish it on the oven what about the ingredients for 1 or 2 pizzas thanks divide by 7 the amount of ingredients then multiply by 1 or 2 depending on how many pizzas you want thank you so much for this best pizza ever wow bravo you are welcome bravo this works just great i ended up adding 30 of soy flour and it still works amazing i let it sit in fridge for few hours before putting them out for 6 to 8 hours for yeast to work very nice i love the classical song viva opera can you put it in the fridge after making the dough balls and then take out the fridge next day and leave it for 5 or 8 hours and then use it is the tomato sauce out of the can or is it made just put a liter flour here is it possible freeze these doughs at some point and activate them later at what point in the process would it be best yeast gets to work upon exposure to sugars so even when u put them at 5 degrees in the fridge the activity is on but at low metabolic rate whilst studies indicate freezing dough can destroy yeast cells you can try out typically to freeze them once good amount of fermentation has been done dough leavening or quality is the issue upon freezing semi fermented doughs at home i think i would assume that this would be the reason why packaged frozen or refrigerated doughs come with more additives such a dough conditioners which can add to overall strength to bread quality i am surya thank you for your response so halfway or end of final overnight fermentation would be the best guess to try i guess experiment and see what works or if how it does where are you in hollywood da leggere con la promuncia napoletana ahahah im from sicily and i have family in new

cows 53oz is 1 500kg not 1500kg dumb fuck 1 liter is 4 3 cups and you didn t use 4 3 cups of water dumb fuck people think why would someone hand out a recipe from his restaurant finally i found this recipe this is what i m looking for thank you for sharing i ve join to you already please come to my channel to see mine can we get measurements for half the size wow perfection let s get married you are wonderful truly i would take you as my husband nikki jones the living definition of desperation hello could you please me the why is it placed 0 34 oz honey 10 gr miele in the pizza dough yeast feeds on sugar honey contains sugar more food for the yeast equals faster fermentation i m pretty sure that s nowhere close to 1l of water compared to that kg of flower little trick i using to make it fast first fermentation 1hr is a little bit too much 30 min is good enough second fermentation 1 hr is fine after that do the balls put in a tray like in the video and put in the oven off with a bowl full of boiling water just straight out of a kettle in this way you will create a perfect environment for a fast fermentation warm and humid in 2hr or less you will find your balls at the same size of the video if you can afford to wait 10 hrs do it it s better the pizza will be lighter to eat but if you are like me in less than 3 you will be already cooking i like your last name lol my is iacobucci bello i want a video for dough for the business outdoor moto forno pizza very intense when he is teleporting closer and closer to the camera lol amazing video dude i m making it right now but the first part with the water and the flour is not coming out like the video is he really using 1 liter of water i put in 1 liter with the yeast then 1 kilo of flour and its still runny any ideas for home made pizza use 0 7 water for 1 flour some olive oil also remember to put enough fluor on the table and sprinkle a bit on the top of the ball before forming it so it doesn t stick no big deal using dry yeast that s usually what you find in the stores that s a low oven practically burned how long should the pizza balls rest if the room temperature is 30 celsius many thanks for very useful video i use almost the same recipe only i put small amount of sugar instead of honey and i put 2 times less dry yeast important to slap the dough i m sure this dough creates an amazing pizza but as he said in the end fast and easy i think not i don t have 10 hrs to make dough hello bakery i thought the same when i heard fast more like i dont have the patience and the italian accent helps the flavor too if an american cook made this video the taste would not be there another great video vito is the man hi very nice recipe i am reading everywhere on internet that the dry yeast should be activated with sugar honey and warm water at about 110 120 f which is about 38 40 c i bought an italien dry yeast and tried to proof activate it with water at different temperature cold room temp tepid 30 c and 38 c it only managed to proof it when it was 38 c is this yeast normal still properly alive i don t know about italian yeast but if i look at swedish websites it says that water should be 37 c if you have fresh yeast and 45 c if you have dry fantastico love the video and how it was made looking forward to making the dough the correct way with the help from you grazie mille from the uk bellisimo did not even use all the flour naplag lawari pare i thought the pizza was going to look like the one in the preview it looked nothing like that at all in my opinion the preview is how a pizza should look but i m going to try to make the dough just to test it out pleace i need i need the recipe just for 500 grams of flour help help hahahahahaha woman lol parece muito boa se um dia for para eua fa o quest o passar a duvida quanto tempo posso deixar essa massa descansar 24h fica ruim obrigado parab ns pelo v deo it looks very good if one day goes to us i d like to spend there doubt how long can i let this dough rest 24hrs gets bad thanks congrats for the v deo muy buen v deo y yo solo entiendo un poco de ingles gracias y eres un campe n what is the italian name for the dough kneading box i d like to find one or make one thanks for all your help la madia made this substituting in my sourdough starter and it was out of this world the ingredient quantities make a perfectly elastic dough it s burned lol you know nothing about pizza let me see you geting that crust in a home oven take out the for the house if you are not cooking it at home nuovo iscritto napoli in the world grande vito cosa ne pensi della farina di semola di grano duro rimacinata why didn t you add all the dough together instead you let half of the dough rise and then you mixed this with more flour and then you let this re rise why not use all the flour at first leftistuprising hi i m not an expert dough maker but if i had to guess i d say it s one of those very subtle expert tricks the humidity or lack of plays a huge part in how much flour to add on any given day so you get most of it in initially and let it rise once then after it s risen you can feel how sticky or dry it is and then you can add the rest only as needed bread dough is so alive and sensitive to surroundings that you have to treat it like a baby don t under feed it or over feed it every kitchen is different so you have to just get used to how it works best where you are i don t have the patience to make it from scratch but i ve worked in plenty of pizza places and i know how the dough reacts to heat moisture etc pretty cool really i agree with roberta first i put 2 3 of the flour in the dough then i let it rest then i add the rest of the flour in my kitchen i never use as much flour as the recipe says because then the bread would be hard as a rock ciao vito sei grande grazie paesano la pizza e venuta molto saporita ho avuto il sapore di napoli in california he s funny i don t mind skin touching my food especially when it s baked but why would you only wear one glove while kneading the dough makes no sense do you shave half your face as well xd i like your pizza thanx for your hard work keep it up i don t have a wooden box and i m waiting on my 3 300 lb pallet of flour so i guess you re out of luck and great work on the conversion to the idiotic imperial system you can order 1500 kg of flour online by the way cheaper than buying it by the kg bag at the grocery well you re my go to for pizza tips now awesome video the best pizza recipe i have ever seen thank you vito you are the best i love your smile how long will this last wrapped in plastic after i put it in the refrigerator i only cook for 2 people and don t want pizza every day can i freeze it don t worry it will be ok for 3 maybe 4 days buy a set of silicon covers that come in varying sizes and use it to cover food its healthier and better than plastic wraps this will show how to make a smaller portion and it is my favorite making pizza video https youtu be n vrntrbypi enjoy for all the americans here s the conversion water 4 25c flour 12 5c or 1 2 3c yeast 1t honey 1t salt 1 76t olive oil 3 5t if you fourth it you will get about 2 dough balls i m frustrated because i just made the dough with 5 grams of sugar instead of 10 you re recipes don t match up your video says 10 your video info says 5 grams thank you for your recipe it s really inspiring love it i wanna try damn all this waiting if you want the dough to do its magic fast just before you oil your initial dough turn on your oven at 500 and wait 5 minutes your oven shouldn t show a temperature when you shut it off after you shut it off cover your dough with plastic wrap in your oiled bowl and put as far away from the heating element as possible let it sit in your oven for 30 minutes when you come back the dough should still be warm and you should think its actually being cooked it is not take the dough out portion it and make your pizza if i only wanted to make one pizza would i just divide the ingredients by 7 since you made 7 balls yes i soobscribe love vito s videos he gives it all away sei un grande ma sei scappato dall italia per andare negli usa ti sei aperto una pizzeria tua o sei dipendente cmq complimenti ottima pizza very very honest video bravo or better yet put it in bakers percent measurements are confusing on the description all

are working commercially you do not need the amount of dough he is making my recipe for 4 calzones or 2 pizzas 2 1 2 measuring cups of flour a pack of active dry year 1 measuring cup of water a

morning from cyprus your new house recipe is great tried it more than twice with great results as solving the honey in the water needs care not to miss parts of it do you think that the honey may be replaced with brown sugar instead which is easier to dilute in the water hi theodorus my trick is to practice to fill a spoon from the honey bottle for the right amount and then put the honey directly in the recipe by eye but brown sugar won t make a difference michel canada belin la pizza bruciata easy and fast waiting 6 to 8 hours is fast obviously normally its 24h and more i my f god man please

to make very good video thank you for sharing if i only have an oven with max temp of 230c how long will it take to bake the pizza some people are blind it clearly says 1 5 kg at the beginning of the video about 53 oz i think the key things are a long rise with little yeast and flour to water ratio of about 1 flour to 0 8 water by weight i use parchment paper and in a hot oven the flavour seems to come from the long slow rise fermentation i generally just use water flour yeast and salt am antonella from malta thank you so much for sharing ur recipie i tried it and it come very good and tasty ingredients list i can t find 10 grams of pure annie 5 grams of dry east help funny hope you don t have an accent on your second language made me laugh i like it man i m so retarded i thought 1 hour

condiviso la ricetta con noi thanks for sharing this amazing recipe with us fake accent la classica pizza bruciata pessimo magari avere il forno a legna a casa what s the recipe for 10kg cause the one in the video is only 1 5kg just multiply all the ingredients by a factor of 6 67 since 10 is 6 67x greater than the 1 5 so 10 grams of honey would be 66 7gr why do you need 22 lbs of dough first divide all your weights by 3 then multiply them by 20 after that if you want you can multiply the result by itself before finding the square root although this won t help much another approach is to subtract the result by the number you first thought of but this method will almost certainly fail omg i have to wait over 10 hours to bake a wow i subscribe maestro vito i need help getting my dough to be airy like yours and show those blackened spots on the crust in my home oven is it possible to get my crust like yours in this video using a home oven i wonder if i may use the dough the day

grams of flour in fresh and dry yeast thank you great video do the math 5g 3 1 667g if you follow his recipe i would say half tea spoon is fine or a bit more if reduce the rest time exact amount of yeast is really not that important i always prefer dry yeast with lfe yeast you never know how active it really is unless you are a baker and use it every day please i need to know where i can buy this box to make the dough whats the name please why do all of you use metrics we in america don t generally have scales to weigh stuff at least not like you all have in a professional kitchen and we use ounces not grams meters or kilos please put the equivalent measures in a banner with the video instead of oriental writing so those of us that would love to learn from you can i would assume their are far more of us that use standard oz cup table spoon and so on wanting to make your recipes then would those of asian decent having the equivalent measure visible while watching the instructional video makes far more sense oh and you didn t tell us what heat to bake it at im going to assume 450 thank you ai carumba the rest of the world uses metric except for the us get a conversion app on any smart phone and you can correctly convert to write down for your reference i divided everything by 5 cuz i want only 1 bigger pizza do i use 1g of dry yeast or 5g for that 1500kg of flour eh see

perfectly and i use your technic i put tomatoes in the oven after few minutes i put the rest of ingredients and in oven thank you dude you rock the the video but you keep spanking your balls and i keep giggling like a school girl call me a snowflake but i find your pizza server doll highly offensive i am not sure of the representation for it being in the video because it s shot in the different angles in the frame i can only suspect it was intentionally placed your establishment may serve a great product but it will not be a place where i patronage i have been on youtube for years and i have never written such a critique about a video very disappointed joey lynn read up on sicily and the moors snowflake blaculo my inner snowflake suggest that one should look up and understand the nuances of customs of the country they business in to maximize profits thank you soooo much for sharing the recipe i tried it the result was really amazing have u used a wood oven or a regular one good pizza super you can be proud and thanks v m how many pizzas do whit 1 5 kg flour great recipe they say theres an app for everything but i cant find one to eat this pizza through my screen my pizzas suck i follow recipes but they always come out different can this recipe be cut in half i d prefer not to use that much flour and make that much pizza all nice and great but you misleading a bit people making pizza for the house oven but yet you use your own professional oven if is for the house then show us how its gonna be in the house my friend peace did you mean to say 1 5kg of flour your written recipe shows 1500kg which would be over 3 000 pounds bill okonski this recipe is not for the casual pizza maker blaculo i guess you have no clue for some reason i got too sticky dough i had to add 200 grams of flour what could be the problem oh why you didn t cut that pizza to show us the pizza make sourdough next time please that s a good pizza does the mouse turd at 1 35 make it authentic bravo maestro we made the dough easy and fast after 12 hours of waiting genial you are the best can i freeze it this dough i have a pizza dough recipe that i really love 3 cups self rising flour and 2 cups greek yogurt room temp mix flour and yogurt then let dough rest for at least 30 min this is for a 16 inch pizza for 12 inch crust 1 1 2 cups flour and 1 cup yogurt i want to use this method in my pizza shop is it possibl please talk me sei un grande complimenti but the flower keeps secret regular all purpose never will work you must have strong flower that produces a lot of gluten totally agree i m sure vito meant to say bread flour all purpose flour is intended for pastry and pasta not any kind of leavened breads he was making a concerted effort to ensure everyone could find the necessary ingredients at their local supermarket i m sure he prefers and uses 50 pound bags of commercial 00 grade pizzeria flour which isn t available for domestic purchase given obvious reasons why speaking with a fake indian accent i believed americans always buy prepackaged dinners ready to eat so forget cups and stay metric good cooks are in eu very ignorant comment lmao great video and thank you for sharing for a italia wooow i enjoyed your video and you accent tip1 put more yeast so you skip 6 8 hours tip2 there is no way this oven is compared to our at home not even close tip3 if you have an oven at your home do this same recipe and use the home oven tip4 i don t have this amazing mozzarella cheese so my pizza looks more modern than traditional that oven is at least at 400c 450c how is that low you can never reach that at home unless you have some expensive equipment everything else was quite clear though very nice dough thank you for sharing in metric units americans can eat frozen pizza i am so hungry now other than making it easy to scrape the sides vs a round bowel is there a benefit to the wood mixing container that s the real deal thx thank u u are very nice person what brand yeast did you use my friend i live with my wife how may pizzas you think i need to make in one night i usually use 1 cup of water 2 5 cups of flour salt honey yeast and that makes 2 large pizzas for us more than we can eat your recipe is for feeding a soccer team and in a convectional oven i can never achieve those bubbles and burnt crispy parts that give the pizza so much flavour unachievable at home paltool this is definitely achievable at home w a baking steel not stone i ve done it his recipe worked well for me though it did over proof probably because i used saf instant active my dough balls splatted out big time but the over proofing didn t matter i just shaped the splatted out pancake balls back into balls again and then stretched it as shown when the dough was at room temp crank your oven to 550f w baking steel in it it will take about 1 5 hours to pre heat my pizza is ready in four minutes on the baking steel complete with puffy cornicione w bubbles and underside leopard spots ps i put my stretched dough on parchment paper top it and then slide it onto the steel on the parchment paper recipe does feed a soccer team that s true just freeze the dough balls pancakes in zip locks after final proofing pull from freezer and bring to room temp when you re ready to make another pizza the dough still tastes just as good i ve tried this recipe vs the 72 hour dough recipe from baking steel and definitely prefer this one though it s a bit more work since it has two 1 hour rises another 8 hour rise give it a try with the baking steel several are sold on amazon you ll be amazed leigh logan thank you my friend yes i ve made many different attempts with this on the stone on the steel steel on top of stone 48 hour ferments but mostly i just make my dough and let it rise i will try letting them over proof and punch them down then form into balls again and let rise some more thank you for your info i will try your style loved the video thank you gracie if i need to cut by half the quantities what about the yeast amazing and how much grams of baker s yeast fresh yeast should i use on the pack it s written 42g for 1 kg of flour i ve read that for pizza it should be better to use less yeast and have longer fermentation good idea to use metric measurements great video gracias great video subscribed right away love making pizza will get some dry yeast and than try this looks amazing thank you hi nice video very different to see u use 1 2 the flour then then other halves every time i watch these videos i get closer and closer to building a wood fire pizza oven in the back yard although i don t think i have the patience for day long dough haha make in the morning have for dinner or make the night before then go to fridge without proving check out the uuni pizza oven gets to 900f and costs 300 can t be beaten matthew i can t help thinking that the dough preparation is the significant take away from this video it s inspired me to up my game i reckon you could build a wood fired pizza oven i ve friends who have and bake supermarket frozen pizzas in it but the oven itself isn t going to make the pizza something it isn t it s almost all in the dough all the best from another amateur pizza maker and fellow matthew look for utube vids by townsends they actually make a mud pizza oven now they do it as colonial times mixing with their feet me i have an electric cement mixer when i make mine i bought a pizza oven unit that is metal on the outside and firebrick within from lowes the idea is to put the box on the top of the grill haven t unboxed but seems like it would work i built one with my father in law about 9 years ago we both read books then planned and built it took 3 000 and 2 months of weekends but it s amazing and we use it often in the summer you have patience to build a wood fire pizza oven but not for day long dough buy a stone for the owen seemsgood do a video if you do build the oven it will probably finish before the pizza is ready to cook vash lash i think it can be beaten by improving its desing i did a 3d model with rocketstove instead of wood pelet burner that is a pizza oven i want becuase i live in area with a lot of forests so you can find small wood everywhere for free vash lash check out the ooni pro pizza oven worth the upgrade from the basic ooni uuni michal viktorin yeah those pellets do get super pricey i ve seen home made brick ovens and it s quite cost effective i ll consider it for sure jim davis yeah wasn t aware of the differences not sure what the difference is between the gas vs the wood in terms of end product i know the pro is a little bit bigger vash lash and the pro is double skinned so reatains the heat better ass for gas i will get one for quickness but ooni shure beats the hassle of building one unless it s for commercial purpose that must be one of the most wasteful and polluting ways to cook a meal trespasser how can you say that using natural wood is the most natural way easy to regrow carbon in equips carbon out what is your method of cooking is it is gas nuclear coal before buying an uuni i tried the baking steel first sold on amazon and i m sure glad i did crust is simply amazing in my oven at 550 let oven continue heating for another hour after it hits 550 the crust comes out perfect leopard spots big puffs in the crust etc i tried one pizza at 500 to see if it made a difference besides baking time and yes big difference not as crunchy and no spots or big puffs felicity joy lol i m going to buy an uuni 3 for this reason i ll give you an easy no yeast no waiting for the dough to rise recipe just flour yoghurt baking powder salt sugar oil or butter is better mix it all together just let it rest for 5 10 minutes and it s ready notice there s no water also you can keep it in the fridge and use it straight away it doesn t matter that s cold i make cinnamon buns smoked cheese bread pita bread etc greetings from saudi arabia same here i dont have much patience to wait for 8 hours ehehehehh but the oven is on my mind make a much more than you need and use it to make tortillas pizza and bread okay i just ate dinner a few minutes ago and now i am hungry again vito you rock grazai for sharing your wonderful recipe greetings from new zealand good thing im having pizza tonight great video what about the burnt parts rob krulish they are traditional because of the type oven and yummy bravo vito lacopelli what hydration percentage do you recommend using when baking in uuni 3 with caputo 00 flour officially in italy

hai la pizzeria io vivo a scottsdale arizona ed ho un ristorante e pizzeria il mio impasto molto simile al tuo solo che io ho un forno blodget a gas il risultato comunque soddisfacente ciao danilo nice dough ugly burnt pizza great video when i visit some of the prominent pizzerias the fragrance of the dough is amazing it s not the infused smell from the wood oven it s something else i have tried red caputo flour with long fermentation using fresh yeast but it never compares with the artisan pizza that these top restaurants turn out i am curious to know which flour yeast or method is used to get this result would really appreciate any help well done thank you for your very helpful videos that looks amazing is it possible to freeze unused dough i just made some pizza dough after having watched this video i use my own recipe but i was looking for some entertainment and maybe to learn some new tricks anyway yes you can freeze pizza dough i do it every time the batch i just made resulted in 2 balls about 430 grams each they each make a 14 pizza i place each new fresh ball of dough in a greased dish with a plastic wrap cover and then place them into the refrigerator to ferment over night they will approximately double in size during this period tomorrow morning late morning i will transfer the dishes to the freezer for a couple of hours to harden the dough then i remove the dough light spray of cooking oil and then final wrap them in plastic wrap and final storage in the freezer defrost them in a covered dish in a warm oven 100 110 deg f for 3 hours works for me great and very useful video man grazie mile americans don t know metric lol very nice but not fast voil real pizza cooked perfectly brilliant mick from uk just subscribed i have made pizza s for over 40 years but still learnt how to make a better pizza dough from this video very nice how you allow the time for the dough to mature i use the same ingredients but do not allow the final rising of dough i will now i always pre cook the dough for a few minutes as you suggest prevents soggy pizza also allows me to add toppings then wrap and put in freezer for future quick meal perfect who else feels anxious about that giant bubble on the crust at 9 50 just did it thanks maestro i was always believer how you made your tometo sauce for pizza in restaurent wow that crust looks delicious thank you for posting this dough i am going to try hello from australia hello vito i am guessing you must mean 1500 grams not 1 5 grams or 1500 kilo grams i think you meant to type 1500 grams which 52 9 ounces so 8 oz 1 cup so divide 52 9 8 6 5 cups approx of flour or 6 61 which is a little more than 6 5 ozs hope this clears up all confusion people if not then i am using my own calc of flour to water ratio thanks lol what s with the box who makes dough in a box wow uncool smooshing the crust so ups just dropped off a skid of 00 flour in my driveway 1500 kilos ain t no joke i had to hire an illegal to

much you must bake to become a master that s some funny sh t lol 1500 kg is like 1 500 000 grams or 3 000 pounds funny how people don t notice anything strange lmfao i put 1kg of flour with 1 liter of water and it was like soupy pancake better what is going on i had to add way more floor this recipe did not work for me at all luke smith 1 liter of water absorbs about 1 5 1 7 kilos of flour it all depends on the flour you are using also it s approximate not exact but about 1 6 kilos of flour per 1 liter of water is what i found works watch this video neapolitan pizza at home by davide civitiello he explains it very well i like this vito guy too but you just have to study a lot to understand the proper way to make the dough everyone does it a bit differently vito s dough seems a bit on the wet side ha ha ha cmnsns how long would we need to knead this for keep in mind i only knead my dough by hand just like in the old country i saw the video but i am sorry to say that some people have problem with calculation here vito say 1 kilo and 500 gram that mean 1 5 kg every 1000 gr is 1 kg then you do not need to have truck wow love this dude love the passion buddy i m about to get a pizza oven and wood fired too i ll let you know how it goes it s a recipe to feed an american family thank you for the video i use some poolish in my dough it gives a nice sour flavor i also use high gluten flour but i wonder if all purpose flour will still be chewy one problem i always have is i cover my peel with cornmeal and build the pizza on it but it still sticks to the peel very frustrating when all the toppings slide off onto the stone and burn and smoke i thought he was going to break the wall and walk into my room when he was introducing himself unfortunately l run out of dry east beautiful awesome video positive guy awesome accent thanks for the recipe where do i buy dry east wtf grams what country you think this is alteast put the conversion grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr ben 10 to 15 and buy a digital kitchen scale once you zero out the bowl it can be set to read grams and kilograms besides for baking you need to be precise and the metric system is very precise nice where s the pineapple chunks great video thanks great except no wood fire stone oven at home du y w maluchu nie wiedzia em e pizze umiesz robi wita driy east lolllll pizza looks fantastic but where is the

your video and making me hungry d excelenteeeeeeeeee this takes way to long to make if i was hungry when i started i would be dead before this pizza is ready there are much quicker quality recipes out there you might be interested in doing a side by side test show the quick recipe as opposed to your recipe and a blindfold test to see if it s worth while waiting all those hours yeah i can t wait 6 8 10 hours i just mix the ingredients for one large pizza and leave it for only 2 hours to rest then i give shape to pizza and put it in the oven pizza of 2 hours waiting is also good the longer you give any bread dough to develop whether it s for sourdough bread or pizza the better the flavor time is one of the most important things in developing a wonderful dough just make a large batch make individual balls pop them in a ziplock freeze it anytime you want pizza just defrost it and you re good to go professional super mario player d dude you fucking rule son grazieeee mille brother goos energy if you want to do pizza at home then aim for home pizza 60 water to flour ratio salt and yeast let it activate for an hour and you are ready no crust but you have decent pizza in 1 hour plus electric hoven or something that heats the pizza top from close distance will get you better results don t add too much sauce or your pizza will come out watery good job yum how many gramms of fresh yeast would you use for that amount of flour thanks for the video i would also like to know this vito please how many grams of fresh yeast instead of dry bravo very well done sir looks great im going to start outside and then walka een hanny and heast i can see that you translated the video description and recipe to arabic as there are mistakes i d be happy to send to you correct translation he says make them 250g and yet his are around 350g otherwise i liked the recipe high water percentage and long fermentation to get good dough taste first time i tried this recipe i got about 10 dough balls you are right his carry more weight and use only 6 7 dough balls good comment made with love good one thanks please also put whole wheat flour pizza dough recipe how come in this recipe you add olive oil in your recipe but in your other dough recipe video you don t does it make a difference also for this particular video did you use ap flour or 00 quest non e accento italiano mi pare che e un rimbambito caffone this is porn for fat people like me grazie where is your restaurant i need a pizza now you just need a stoneoven that heats up a lot more than a standard kitchenoven fantastic can i put the finished dough into the refrigerator ninguna pizza como la del viejo de dale que me cago quemando i tried this recipe and it came out delicious i made pizza the last two years almost every week but it never tasted like this you made me really happy keep up the pizza love this pizza looks soo amazing nice work not everyone has a wood burning oven in their home you have name it for the house so the pizza would idealy be baked in a home house oven great video thanks no showa us the bottom crusta how brown shoulda we a maka that s not an oven you have at home you noodle hi vito thank you for sharing the video very precise and didactic i appreciate very much its very good i like it great information good video thank you much for your time sr got your self a new subscriber grazie tanto i ve never seen a wooden prova box like that before personally i would activate the yeast first with warm water and some brown sugar but hey if the dough rises then it works wait 6 to 8 hrs easy and fast according to the description we need 1500kg of flour now that s a big portion where did you read this flour 100 water 66 7 olive oil 3 33 salt 1 67 honey 0 67 yeast 0 33 yes that s what we want thanks jazagivid i made a mistake in the calculations and also left out the salt i have corrected the percentages is this not a very wet dough for pizza i m typically around 60 62 hydration if one were to use raw sugar instead of honey how would you adjust the amount for what is this exactly i see he makes 7 balls from the total amount in his description when you would reduce this to 1 pizza these measurements are not correct or am i wrong sandor159 think of all of the measurements as percentages or fractions if you want to make 1 pizza you might use 200g of flour since you are using 2 x the amount of flour just multiply the rest of the amounts by 2 or if you were using 150g flour 100x1 5 you would multiply the other ingredient amounts by 1 5 kyle g ohh i see this is all reduced to 100 grams as a base kyle g the amount of sugar is not critical it s for the yeast if the pizza bread turned out to be sweet you have put too much wow wow i like to make mine and freeze it do you ever do this so you have some at home i love to make the pizza but hate the dough takes so long to get ready i make it and then freeze it up all portioned out in 12 inch pies for my home pizza oven on the green mountain grill thanks bro good jop best job in the world you can make a lot of dough in this profession vito i want to make this recipe for two pizzas or even one what i have to change what do u suggest use chicken stock instead of water vito is it possible to change the workflow to not do the 6 8 hour room temp fermentation and instead do a cold fermentation perhaps 3 days or so cold did he ever answer i d like the answer also i hope you re not using 1500 kilograms of flour that one and a half ton hahah yes is 1 500 ciao vito great video here in germany it is no

video great video can i make a good pizza using just 250g of flour and a little bit dry yeast all recipes i saw use 1kg of flour but it is so much for me and recipes with less flour need a lot of yeast congrats from brazil i enjoy all your videos i have an outdoor woodfire oven i use it several times a week pizza is definitely a passion of mine where can i purchase a wooden box like that have a great day can you freeze the dough i would probably pre bake it with the tomato sauce and freeze the pizza i tried freezing some dough it wasn t so good i don t think so but you can leave it at 2 6 c for two or three days with no problems at all you re the best vito thanks for sharing your pizza now will be eaten in germany kindly regards from bavaria very good job u r nice man with nice presenting if you have a regular oven at home i found it best to preheat to 250c with the pan you cook it on heating up aswell only then put the pizza on it and it will bake enough from the bottom how long do u bake it for i made the dough and i m desperate to find sbdy who succeeded making it in a regular oven did u use parchment paper donutmom23 i use parchment paper and spread the dough out on it with a thin layer of flour then drag it on the hot pan just make sure you don t burn yourself and don t drop it cooking time is not very long maybe 10 14 minutes i always check after 10 if the cheese has brown spots the dough is usually cooked you can also bake the stretched dough until it becomes barely brown the same 250 c temp then just turn it upside down and proceed with putting the sauce and ingredients this way the dough won t get wet while baking here a chef s trick if you don t wanna burn your fuc ng hands if you have a gas stove simply put the ready to go in the oven pizza on a baking paper on the tray and put it on the gas stove and fire the try until freaking hot takes just a minute then put it in the pre heated oven with a pizza stone inside on the highest rack if pizza bakes too long it gets fuc ng dry so bake as hot and quickly as possible play with your oven maybe use the top grill for a minute as well to get color quickly check out g3 ferrari pizzaoven nice thanks dear greetings from the brazilian amazon rainforest in manaus donutmom23 i have a pizza stone i wait 10 minutes from the time the oven has reached the temperature for the stone to get hot inside then i put in my dough which i have placed over a circle of parchment paper it works perfectly it cooks well on the bottom and it doesn t stick to the stone get a pizza oven regular oven is crap when making pizza donutmom23 i use a stone inside the oven or a baking tray the cooking time is 8 9 minutes and this after the oven been heated for 25 minutes at 550 f degrees ok a g3 ferrari pizzaoven works very nice if you haven t one get a pizza stone pre heat stone at max temp usually 250 c for home oven for 15 20 minutes or longer put the pizza directly on the stone no need for paper flour and of course no oil pizza does not stick to the stone it sticks only when sauce of cheese flow onto it i made it n buonissim0 bravo bravo lodi idol very nice chef and professional and easy to

know why for the flour of the pita pizza how much protein is supposed to be thanks for your continued support amaazing this recipe is a little different then your recipe you had a couple years ago for the house that one did not include honey and it mixed in salt before mixing in the flour do you believe this one is better than the other recipe yes grande video finalmente uno che spiega come usare quella cavolo di dry yeast bravo ma davvero sei professionista da quando avevi 8 anni how many days can the dough balls be stored in the freezer followed your recipe to perfection thank you maestro i ve had problems with my pizza being too watery in my home oven i ve found that i need to use mozzarella that has been wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and feels very dry compared to that in liquid i bake my pizza on a steel under the broiler grill in my home oven until it starts to look darker on the crust on top use cow mozz not buffalo or drain your buffalo over night shredded in a seiv yep we have the same issue here water on the pizza when in the oven which we narrowed down to the wet mozzarella don t use buffalo mozzarella use cow if you have to use buffalo shred it and drain it over night i found that all the toppings on the pizza including the sauce need to be as dry as possible i cook down my sauce almost to a paste and i use pre shredded whole milk low moisture mozzarella sometime i do use fresh mozzarella because i like how stringy and chewy it is but try to get it as dry as possible before using you should never ever ever ever cook down pizza sauce you suck all the soul and freshness out of it just use a little tomatoes sauce you don t need alot sir wilhelm steinway i thought all it does is evaporate water the flavor usually stays there rite i mean you can t boil it out or can you yes it concentrates the flavour to much pizza sauce should be sweet and zingy and fresh when you reduce tomatoes sauce it goes very rich and earthy which is exactly what you don t want trust me good sweet plum tomatoes salt and basil are all you need add the mozzarella towards the end of the baking that way it won t liquify entirely and your pizza wont be watery try buying a block of mozzarella behind the deli counter instead of the stuff that comes in water it s hard enough to grate and eliminated my water problem which i always had even when drying the wet stuff to the nth degree the pre shredded stuff just doesn t taste the same and turns an odd color i tried it re the sauce get certified san marzano whole peeled tomatoes if grocery doesn t have order on amazon squeeze the tomatoes by hand or gently w an immersion blender to consistency you like after i did these things no more water problem on the pizza asshole how much flour altogether you fucking wako stupid italian it must be delicious i will try your recipe i think it will be the best pizza in my life dzi ki za przepis bravo chef hi vito how long is the pre cocking with the tomatosauce american cooks take note this guy keeps it clean and metric none of the rest of the world has any clue what you mean by cups cups are easier cs it sounds easier until you realize that the cup used in the recipe was nothing like your cup and everything comes out different d lol cs the proper way of measuring flour is by weight i thought everyone knew that volumetric measuring is ridiculous anyway just weigh your stuff ok then don t be an ass about it yeah but now i need a scale kevin millsyup instead of a dozen measuring cups you just use a scale and finally just plain sea salt not the fancy kosher stuff yes best way is to measure flour by weight then learn cups and oz s usa is the world s leading consumer bow to us and screw your globalism shit too julio cg a dozen measuring cups wtf 2 cups 1lb measure dry shit 1st use the same 1 cp can t u eye ball 1 oz jane doe well actually the cup weight unit got a little bit old so there is a universal measure for the word cup which was regulated a few years ago same as the measure kilo which changed last year yeah a kilo today is not the same as a kilo from 1000 years ago and it will be a new example of what a kilo weights usually in forms of mini hammers redesigned for this year but yeah no one gives a shit about this thing and when those cunts upload a recipe for youtube they don t actually consider what a cup of flour stands for instead they just measure everything on their cup king manta pro tip usa doesn t regularize or universalize everything so get your fucking shit together and stop being so arrogant hi americans im from the uk and know exactly what you mean when you say cups thanks cups are easy to understand when you know 1 cup is 250 ml justa viewer you take note dumb ass scales comes in ounces and grams so now the rest of the world has a clue of what we mean by cups except your illiterate ass our system of volume measurement is not metric it s binary which is cooler it helps to have a scale to weigh in metric portions especially stuff like flour mike foodee yeah in every recipe that includes flour you should weigh it especially when making bread dough cs yes especially those starbucks cups the rest of the world doesn t matter carlos cuellar kosher salt is not fancy and quite common sea salt has become the fade jane doe a cup is a standard unit of measure its not just any cup available you act like each cup is different its not a cup is a cup like a litre is a litre mike foodee flour should always be weighed you are correct sir darren pilkington thanks darren 0 im the reverse use u s weights and measures but i have a grasp on metric this is the case for people born 1980 and later for americans mary lafrance indeed it does especially when making pastry well any real cook uses weight anyway when they re baking sparky frank elliott binary is just the base you use you can use imperial and metric either in base 2 or 10 it doesn t matter what anyone does anymore it is never good enough done right or like mama did it just say thank you vito thank you for the amazing video and go google how to measure for whatever part of the world you live in miguel marquez using metric is far easier than a cup and a coup may vary depending of the the cup you use a liter will be always a liter n d how long all the time 1 cup was 230 ml then why is america 1 country in the world adventure eugene america is the 1 cup in the world justa viewer that takes to long xicara bello haha how about you be you and us will be us wooosh wooosh are you responding to me derrick bundy no i m responding to the original comment j v no he does it by weight which is also how almost all professional cooking and baking is done volume is too variable rest of the world needs to create a their own internet and youtube the american gift to you justa enjoy hahaha love it justa viewer or any clue what real freedom is always bake by weight i m american and it s the best way king manta if you want to work in an us pizzeria learn italian and metric system danthrax66 don t eat food made in the rest of the world jane doe i totally prefer measuring by weight for recipes but what you are saying is incorrect the reason is that if you use the same cup to measure all ingredients the percentages of the recipe come out correct whether you make 1kg of dough or 1 2kg is not really important however measurement by weight is best because it s easier you just put your bowl in a scale tare the scale and add ingredients and more precise which is more important for baking yeah i wish we would that s the only thing you foreigners do better though lol jk i understand cups measurements maybe you are not quite smart to read the measurements proportions or equivalents king manta a dozen measuring cups wtf 2 cups 1lb 2 cups of what 1 lb i m guessing whatever you say it is jose echevarria i understand cups measurements maybe you are not quite smart to read the measurements proportions or equivalents there s nothing to understand they re just a poor excuse of a measurement that you can t even maintain throughout a single recipe cups tablespoons teaspoons sticks pinches even the best american bakers will indicate the real recipe in grams and percentages papalevies except the various cups tablespoons and teaspoons are all varied relative to each other not to mention that they might be tightly packed lightly packed heaped or level it s not just a matter of measurements either unless you use units that are congruent with one another you will never be able to understand how ingredient ratios works and don t forget the soccer i mean the rest of the world s football lol it s not the world s problem if you are not smart enough to use a cup mark strachan you spelled incompetent wrong justa viewer http www dianasdesserts com index cfm fuseaction tools measures measures cfm eugenrullz a cup is exactly 8 fluid oz or 238 588 millilitres measuring cups in north america typically have metric and imperial labelled the problem with with cups or millilitres is that it is a measurement of volume when working with flour it s better to go by weight because the flour density is never consistent i love this video will try this recipe as for your comment i have to say 50 grams of olive oil really that s difficult living in switzerland it is e trembly difficult to cook using cl and dl measurements as well it s a matter of habit and having the measuring cups with all systems then we can all cook anywhere who cares what the rest of the world does america is greatest country in the world and we do what we want since i m not cooking for the world i don t care nice job you found another opportunity to take your euro smug for a spin around the block https youtu be mn1br8qgkh8 i use my hands different brands of the same ingredient have different densities keeping it to mass makes sure you get the same amount of matter every time mericans better stay away from the kitchen anyway king manta arrogant american you probably think pizza hut serves real pizza cs when baking it s all about a scale you even have to weigh the liquids stavros meggos real football i was taught simply to spoon flour into the measuring cup and level never scoop and pack that s where most go wrong when baking as far as the rest of it that s why they make conversion charts i bake both ways sometimes i use a scale sometimes i just want to use the measuring cups and be done with it goldenstate i have never weighed a liquid in my life and i ve never made a dry cake or bad loaf of bread eugenrullz nope youre wrong a cup unit of measure is always a cup just like the other person said its always 250 ml you think americans grab any cup thats just stupid justa viewer hahahaha cups are a measure of volume not weight mike foodee its more convenient because you don t need a scale i make my fough with 3 cups of flour and measure everything else with a soup ladle half is a teaspoon a ladle and a half is a tablespoon dough comes out perfect everytime julio cg you don t need measuring cups you just need a single measuring cup and two spoons or you can cheat like me and use a soup ladle lord escanor it is recommended to use a scale to measure flour if you want consistency since you have made dough and are proficient at it you can get by without a scale and get good results but for people who don t make dough on a regular basis should weight the flour its shocking to see the actual difference most people scoop cups of flour weigh 1 5x more than they should test it out chill out bro 1500 kg of flour that s a shitload of flour 56squadron hahahah the exact response that is expected of an arrogant american keep up the good work cunt 1500 kg 3306 lbs of flour cs 1 cup of kosher salt is not the same as 1 cup of table salt lol you are such a miserable person last time i checked american cooks use scales jane doe nice dough thank you then why is making the video in english fkuc cups it s baker s percentage all the way justa viewer i prefer the american system better than metric justa viewer he doesn t keep it metric he uses weight you can do the same thing in ounces in case you didn t know justa viewer yes generally you are right but when we say a cup is a specific portion does not depend on the cup we have at home you can see that on metric containers were there is oz ml and cup cs two different cups of flour will have different weight that is why flour you go by weight i am american and i measure flour by grams do not be a snobbish ass and generalize right on metric is a binary measurement not based in reality i don t like using it as it has no frame of reference in reality 10 is 10 but has no frame of reference other than the what is being counted by whom the dif is that a foot is a measurement in real time and relates measurement to a foot a real foot metric has no frame of reference and does not need a reality to measure that seems a weird kind of denial and one would assume in time one using this measurement would run into discrepancies that reality will cause but the measurere would never consider or understand greg leighton he s right about your muslim problem they will outbreed you re native born population in 40 years you ll be a minority in your own nation you should feel ashamed of your ignorance of islam ya ll are being silly the amount of flour you need changes depending on humidity and temperature because it will absorb some moisture from the air being anal about the exact weight or exact volume is almost irrelevant in a home setting do it if you like to be more consistent precise but in most cases you will have to add a bit more or less flour and there s a pretty wide margin of error when it comes to pizza dough anyway there s no reason to treat baking at home as rocket science or souffle just learn from your fucking mistakes and adjust it for next time edit your ability to discern the texture and how it feels is much more important this and the practice to get there is much more important than arguing about metrics fuck off jane doe ohhhhh thats way ohhhhh yes cup is on the s i system also when you perform an experiment in physics you measure in cups i live in the u k and everything is clear you use litres when you refuel your car but the consumption is in mpg you buy milk and beer by pints and the spirits by litre the imperial gallon is different from the us one people in the hospital they tell you the weight of your baby in kg and people between them measure in pounds wtffffffffff everything is clear british american tobacco they know best sam petersen yup american here who just got into bread baking a few months back and you absolutely have to weigh your ingredients for consistent results one of the more frustrating things going from cooking to baking not being able to eyeball things but man fresh baked bread is worth the hassle se an farris ya most seasoned bakers can tell by the feel of the dough but for us newbies weigh weigh and weigh some more i stopped measuring liquids only in things i have made a lot is it a metric hour or an imperial hour p it s too bad because our way is more exact than metric you re probably a lousy cook anyway n d in europe germany we say 250ml to 1 cup exactliy ist 236 6 ml per 1 cup 236 5 ml nothing makes me more mad than a recipe that says 1 tsp of butter ffs how am i going to put the butter in spoon justa viewer euro cooks and the rest of the world take note none of the rest of the world has ever matched the usa as a world power all the accomplishments taken for granted and we did it using cups and pounds fancy that maga trump2020 dixler mudflap mudflap first this is not about power it is about cooking second our power is not measured in pounds and cups american scientists do not use cups and pounds and everything in american medicine is not in ounces it is grams kilograms milliliters milligrams or cc s godgunsgutsandnra first i watched this vid because i have been trying to get a thin crispy new york style crust for years and have failed so far i am aware this is a cooking demo and not about the usa s military might second i have a major in geology with a minor in chemistry well versed in the metric system of weights and measures third i am proud of my country and its accomplishments that includes our vast infrastructure that was excavated in cubic yards and tons the avoirdupois system has held up well and while i agree we should have switched over to the metric system decades ago i am tired of being preached to by the euro elites regarding our system ps when you are reloading your shells are you weighing out the smokeless powder in grams or grains okay sorry for ruffling your feathers i apologize for the stress i may have caused now back to pizza pa bl thank you for your concern vark well said don x really mate how come what s the nanometer in imperial please you don t know mathematics and you want to use fractions and at the end of day is not imperial nor american units they have been used from greeks egyptians and persians when the states were not even in our maps however we comply and we progress with the rest of the world sometimes it s good to be in the same page dixler mudflap mudflap first sorry if i ruffled your feathers but i am also very proud of our country i understand what you are saying about being preached to by the euro elites but i realized that it stems from jealousy of what our country has accomplished i sort of equate it to being at a charity ball and the most beautiful woman walks in immediately every other woman in the room starts nitpicking everything about her our country is that beautiful woman and she just smiles at them never doubting her beauty second i purchase my shells and have never tried reloading it is something i am interested in doing third i have a dual phd s in molecular biology and biochemistry so i am familiar with the metric system but in much smaller amounts than cubic yards or tons i have always found geology very fascinating but never had time to delve into it to be honest my interest is more toward the precious metals gemstones i do have according to my husband a weird interest in earthquakes fourth for that thin crispy new york crust i purchased square pizza stones from amazon and i turn my oven to max temp to preheat the stones i place them on the lowest rack preheat the oven use a laser temp gun to make sure the bricks are at 500 f before adding my pizza i have found that making the pizza on parchment paper facilitates an easy slide off the pizza peel the parchment paper can take the heat and the crust is thin crispy the crust is ok but i wanted the higher temp and that wood fired crust taste so we are building a wood fired pizza oven out by our pool now i want a pizza vark if you used our system mate you d understand the flaws of yours good pizza eh b e l c h i have no idea what you mean by clean i clean as i go and i don t care what the rest of the world uses stfu you arrogant dick bag i m from portugal and i ve cooked all over the world and americans do just fine converting nyc is king of pizza king manta lol mike foodee so if i measure it by weight won t the grams be different if the flour has moisture but he wpildvw gotten double the views if he did use cups i guarantee it boe dillard minimal difference if any justa viewer so learn what a cup of something means or shut the fuck up about it it s that simple if you can leave comments on youtube you can take your dumbass to google and figure it out or would you rather someone explain what a cup of something is using paper and a box of crayons if you re really that dumb i can try and explain it to you but i can t understand it for you too a cup is 8 oz mamon jane doe mamona a cup is a metric cup of 8 oz smh doesnt mean qrab any cup u feel like dan petre better off to learn albanian at least in nyc cc although we use cups and the spoons table spoons in canada grams and kilograms make more sense you can have all purpose flour in a cup which yields roughly 140 grams pack that 1 cup a little too much and get 160 grams of flour if your recipe needs 12 cups but pack your cups too tight then you really added 14 cups which ultimately will fuck up your whole recipe i don t have a scale so i measured of cups in a brand new 5lb bag of flour divide 5lbs by of cups then do the grams or kg conversion it was about 12 cups however 2 of 12 were added during the kneading and dusting so i would do 6 cups for sponge and then mix in 4 cups with salt and oil after the sponge doubles save 2 for adding dusting prepping etc carlos cuellar i used pink himalayan salt lol what are you going on about if you re so good at math easy to convert for american is ridiculous ok but pizza is italian go back in mc donald is ridiculous cooks or not king manta no i dont know why its turning into this but i guess i will join in too unit of measure is one thing the rest of the world has right over us we just need to switch over fully not a big deal we should just do it and cross it off the list done thank you corey h never i think trump should introduce his own measuring system 2 trumps of flour 100 grams of flour julio cg so weighing water is better than by volume i think it s the same but yes flour should be by weight kevin mills i ve had a scale for about 5 years i don t know how i cooked without it goldenstate i thought you weigh the cook and then add the amount of ingredients accordingly this debate has one simple answer usa s food is shit europe s food is delicious so take your cups and shove it in your ass carlos cuellar i mean yeah sea salt us the best kosher is just so that kosher jews can eat it miguel marquez yeah but the rest of the fucking world doesn t use cups adventure eugene sadly not anymore we are goin downhill fast europe way ahead of us in lifestyle and wellbeing american cook here this is what happened when i used cups https wifflegif com gifs 545727 horror movie movie horror gif 1 cup equals 250 ml i used cups ummm we know what cups are who doesn t who doesn t measure in cups n d again ml is not weight ml is volume again it s easy metric is a must for consistency of recipes 56squadron come on this is a video about pizza why are u so angry at muslims we have nothing to do with pizza my friend americans don t care what the rest of the world thinks we are america metric never beat imperial in a war ever not napoleon not hitler not nobody cups it is errol kim amen metric in theory only bc i used exactly 1l of water and 1kg of flour during the first step and the dough resulted very liquid i think i ll have to balance that with more four at the 2nd step i hope to save it stop it ok its the school system not us if you care that much tell that crap to them they are to busy brain washing us in there school system but show you the elite at the top that do know it yet dumb down the black people for the most part than say the black people is dumb and have low iqs but have there pick of black people that they let learn it that is made rich by them the white people to fool the world into thinking that its equal education and it is not they also do this to poor white people but there poor white people is our rich white people if we try to teach our kids our self the system attack us and send in child protection service on us if we try to give our kids a better education chabbaquq yahudah yahisreal you nailed it so cups are a great idea as it saves all the weighing out if you buy a set of cups it greatly speeds up the measuring try it you need to buy a set of cups you can t just use a cup the standard set of cups makes measuring very fast and easy try it thumper man it speeds it up but is also more inconsistent than weighing out your ingredients think about it a level cup of flour and a slightly packed cup of flour will have different weighs if a recipe calls for say 10 cups that difference will add up sure you can use that and it will probably work fine especially if you bake cook a lot and can eyeball the rest of ingredients accordingly but that s by no means a consistent and reliable way to measure ingredients jane doe any educated american has no problem using either imperial or metric in fact schools in the us have been teaching using both measurement systems for over 40 years but take note it s only people from countries that haven t put men on the moon that seem to have difficulty with people in the us using imperial i agree cups kilos yes bare in mind that the type of flour used changes the whole basics as also the ambient tepeture will afec the fermentacion proces flour allredy has salt added dependen on the flour you use hi there american fellow here i must admit i very much like the metric system i do have a difficult time guessing weights and measures at a glance but once learned i m sure the base 10 math would be much better i also like how each measurement can be traced back to water and relate to each other however i do not understand why people feel the need to insult others about it i know that we americans have an ugly american stereotype which might make you feel the need to get us back but believe it or not we re not all the ass holes portrayed on television though admittedly i am an overweight christian white male who owns multiple firearms and all you do by attacking something as silly as our weights and measures just makes you look worse than people accuse us of being i m sorry we measure stuff in a confusing way im sorry we aren t a commonwealth of her majesty the queen i m sorry we dropped the u from color and harbor i m sorry we say aluminum instead of aluminium lol had to fix autocorrect just to spell aluminum the way everyone else does but can t we just get past our differences and agree that cricket is just the worst sport ever cristian radu wow christian you don t really live up to your namesake do you i ve had good food in the states and i m sure there s bad food in europe admittedly i ve never been there s good and bad in mexico australia canada papua new guinea and indonesia i m probably not as well traveled as a european many more countries there in close proximity and i only travel for work either way i m sorry if our system of weights and measures is so insulting but may i please forego the insertion of my cooking utensils into my rectum we don t care what the rest of the world thinks carry on mike foodee this is why you are not making youtube videos you are spending too much of your time weighing every ingredient pros do everything using standard measuring cups and spoons this is why these things were invented to speed things up all purpose flour is all purpose flour and a cup is a cup no need to weigh everything usually recipes give you cup measures a gram more or less will not change anything if you had any cooking experience you would already know all this i would think you have a background in hard sciences like chemistry or physics which i don t believe was ever a requirement for making pizza adam px you obviously don t have a clue every trade has its own language in cooking its standard measures like cups and tablespoons everyone understands this you are confusing cooks with pharmacists carlos cuellar kosher salt is nothing fancy just regular sea salt that a rabbi pissed on or something like that cs https youtu be jvxzpttnjyq cs https youtu be jvxzpttnjyq julio cg https youtu be jvxzpttnjyq n d a cup of liquid is different to a cup of flour which is also different when it comes to sugar and fine powders cups are a bad idea because a cup of flour and a cup of sugar have different weights converting a cups recipe into metric is a pain in the ass well we are not europeans on the rest of the world we are americans king manta leading consumer of junk food maybe cups and oz s are ancient most civilized countries changed to metric like australia and uk appaddict01 awesome thanks jane nobody asked you get on board with english measurements if it works for the largest economy in the word it must be the best ther are quite a few conspiracy theory s about the metric system however i don t subscribe to them get with the program you can always use a converter help yourself to a relaxing cup of tea with 1 2 teaspoon of honey or one ounce of bourbon julio cg exactly julio cg the problem arises because 1500 kg is the equivalent to 12 000 00 us cups according to the conversion calculator on the internet does this seem right to you if he meant 1 5 kg he should have listed that correctly 1 5 kg is equivalent to 12 us cups of flour sounds more reasonable doesn t it we do not have easy access to kg scales in the us because we do not use the metric system here the cheapest kg scale i could find costs 120 usd this should be taken into account if he s going to promote his videos recipes in the usa unless he doesn t care if we share his videos or recipes with others here in the us what s the point of sharing his videos recipes if they are to difficult for americans to convert makes it pointless doesn t it jane doe i m starting to understand adventure eugene you think usa is the 1 country in the world funny darren pilkington ok boomer king manta i like your comment bravo screw the rest of the world does anyone know the name of his restaurant jane doe take note america is the world king manta usa is the leading consumer of fatty foods there s no doubt about that sadly a large portion of that country has been reduced to third world status just take a tour around cups and oz s is archaic and clumsy get on board with the rest of the planet lmao i m an american florida man born and raised and i can use metric and also not judge the rest of the world for being salty about units of measurements and because they apparently find it archaic to learn more than one way to do something americans even our 6 year old children generally have no issue converting measurements to metric with modern resources so what s really the rest of the world s problem why trivialize something you re admittedly ignorant to sounds like a personal compensation issue there s pros and cons to both and both work very well yet both are imperfect especially when it comes to bread which we should be sharing with each other instead of these comments but y all suck and don t spread any love dafuq jane doe one standard us cup 8oz which is about 240ml when you are talking volume this should be done using weight instead yeah there s no need to be an a about it so why don t you have a cup of go f ck yourself eugenrullz 3 wut the you are 100 correct why you add 3 8 ounce of salt an 4 19 of sugar into the dough it s really simple don t listen to this 5 14 2 tall chef his ferrari does 0 62 mph in over 5 seconds hey julio who the fuck uses dozens of measuring cups only a dumbass who can t understand the mystery of american measuring cups somehow we have made it with out your advice let s keep it that way there s not one inch of metric on the saturn v rocket no he keeps it in weight every good baker i have met uses weight miguel marquez except is is not when you bake flour packs liquid does not but then you have 2 measuring systems when you can use just one 120 grams of flour in a cup anyone who can t do a simple conversion with their head or a pencil should go back to their school and sue them mike foodee if you need to measure by weight you re not a good cook plain and simple cs cups for mummies gallowglass lol like you know what you re talking about time to wake up wait what who measures with cup haha hahaha sehr gut jane doe nah everyone has a set of standard measuring cups for dry ingredients and glass containers for wet ingredients with markings for cups oz ml it s not that complicated we also use teaspoons and tablespoons i m sure everyone has at least one of each in their kitchen isn t easier to use 1 tsb instead of measuring 5 grams i bet you anything by the time you measure your grams on a scale i m already done collecting all the ingredients in units of cups oz tsp and tsp and i m already halfway through the recipe hahahaha eugenrullz hahaha no no no a cup is a cup no it doesn t vary it s standard it s not your coffee cup your glass your bottle or some arbitrary container that you decide to call a cup lol there is a standard measuring cup and everyone has a set cheap and doesn t occupy much space just the space of one cup certainly cheaper and smaller than a scale not a big deal you people are confused and making it too complicated it s much simpler and faster than weighing ingredients and just as accurate thomas whitmore thats what i was thinking 1 5grams maybe adventure eugene in war crimes cs and totally imprecise really first time i m learning about cup measurments not being used in other countries what kind of wooden bowl is that does anyone know thank you for this braavo chief sara anche buona ma da italiana la vera pizza la mangi solo in italia this is easy for home right subscribed cause i love pizza u dont cover dough with plastic film because yeast need to breath use just towel vito likes flour just as much as gordon ramsay likes olive oil imagine if the two of them made a pizza together wtf u mean 1500 kg what kind of dough is this that s fat af maestro non l hai escrito in greco siamo tanti greci che amiamo mangare a l italiano una faccia una razza non si dice hello vito from croatia hope you will come here some day best pizza chef ever great it s impossible to get this result without a wood oven voil i don t like new versions you burned that pizza its aint healthy and not even taste property ehh thanks for your dough but the ending just disapointed me i m sorry but do you know what burns is this is the texture of a wood burning oven and why you say that is not healthy actually in my city bari if the pizza is not black on the crust they don t eat it i grow up eating black pizzas and i m still alive 0 haha thank you for watching see you soon for more videos 1 5 kg of flour is way more than i ever use it would be nice to know how much to put for just 2 or 3 pizzas name of the music at 10 23 please vito i conti non tornano 1 5 kg 1l 2 5 kg 7 palline 360 gr non 250 gr prego spiegati yeah you say to precook the dough and then you not doing it then you say low heat yet your pizza is somewhat burned that pizza looks awesome really good thanks for the instruction vito is so handsome love your videos all good just one advice let it rest for 12 18hours why is this irish guy making apizza i love the sound of that crust crunching next time i make pizza i will give this a try how did they make pizza back in the days when they did not have plastic wrap d this looks awesome i ve been looking for the perfect dough recipe and experimenting with different ones i haven t found one that gets the nice char on it like that yet even with my pizza steel so hopefully i can achieve that with this one adding some honey or sugar to the yeast to jump start the fermentation process makes total sense thanks for this thanks vito for making yet annother great video could you tell us what temperature your oven was approximately when you said it was low grazie great i like it how can you not like and subscribe go vito damn he just taught me how to makr pizza from scratch grazie maestro thanks for sharing did you use instant yeast or active dry yeast easy and fast xddd easy and fast 12 hours of dough rising hola vito super video is this 1 litre seems like a half i mixed 1 kg with 1 litre and the result was much more liquid than yours yeah i just asked the same question mine was really liquidy didn t look like it was 1 liter bravissimo maestro i try to do pizza dough but it s always a disaster the dough look too much like bread dough when i cook it its only 3 ingredients and its the most difficult thing to do what s make the elasticity in a pizza dough there must be a secret sometime i wonder if it s because of the yeast the problem i use the fleischmann yeast maybe that is the problem is there much difference in dry yeast or they all the same it can t be perfect at home cause you use a stone oven big difference you should do a video with a regular oven is using a wooden container better to make the dough if yes why no is not better but if you use it it will assorbe a little more the humidity grazie mille vito thanks to you i am making pizza every weekend and my friends are loving it i preheat my home oven with the tray upside down and use a pizza peel to place the pizza on the tray works like a charm thanks again can t wait to see more videos dry yeasts is designed for fast dough but you suggest to wait for a day in my opinion the minimum increase in size is two times when the dough is ready but dough balls didin t increase much but like around thirty percents i would like to suggest to add kefir fermented milk to make the dough more soft and tasty but i am not sure kefir exists on the shelves in us imo clear water is just a base but you may add a filling to make the taste slightly like milk this would have fit with cheese btw honey is just a sugar here to accelerate yeasts growth you may just use sugar with the same purpose there wouldn t be any difference at all honey doesn t have any perceptible flavour in pizza being suppressed by tomato and cheese flavours withal sugar is better for yeasts than honey this is a classic napolitan pizza and is best in its original form orelse he is a pizzaiolo and runs this huge restaurant he doesn t needs your suggestions if he wanted to bring complications he could have how did you manage to burn the dough to coal colour it s just a melted half pound of mozzarella on the burned loaf you did good when you was making the whole pizza by hands but in my opinion there is not enough perfection in the shape anyway this pizza looks pretty but i just distracted by black burned parts of coal nice and crusty shows us how to do it at home puts it in a wood burning oven so how low was that low in that pizza oven at home we can t get more than 250 300c i will make one at my house very soon vito iacopelli great thanks if you know what temparature is the low setting in your pizza oven you can tell us now hi vito thank you for the video just a little bit of advice if you refer to a different video how to bake pizza at home you should link it in this video that is how you make it easy for the viewer and it will make them happy and subscribe thank you so much yes i m posting the video next week yes vito iacopelli thanx for ur hard work question why do u only autolyse half of the flour instead of all of the flour wouldnt that mean that only half of the flour was properly hydrated autolysed the 2nd half of the flour was not autolysed at all anybody knowledgable please reply soon i like one of your other recipes a lot better why don t you add the olive oil and salt in the water in the beginning you have before i took one of your recipes and tweaked it and made it my own and everyone loves it keep up the videos buddy can you store it in the freezer and for how long if i can in the freezer for a large pizza x1 it will be 1 cup of tepid water 1 tbsp dry yeast 1 tsp honey 3 cups flour 1 tsp salt 2 tbsp olive oil recipe is completely wrong for 1 cup of water 1 5 cups flour is way too little i had to add more like 3cups of flour why do you use cups whyyy 1 tbsp of yeast seems excessive for 1 cup water milen nedkov because we can man dude seriously that s why you are just fuc ng average you get a killer recipe here and messed it up because you know better a pizza is somewhat a wet dough deal with it and try to master it there are bread doughs out there with much higher hydration you also wanna fuc ng add 3 damn cups of your crappy flour there seriously dude milen nedkov because we are unique and nobody can figure my secret recipes ask the colonel if it works for this chicken daniel christian i m going to have to try this i make a recipe that came with my

than burnt bread or dough are you so sure that this pizza is burnt tell me why if you know vito iacopelli i watched the video burnt black charred dough nasty throw that burnt crap in the garbage and try again hi thank you for the step by step lesson very precise and the dough looks perfect i have a question according to what i found out in other sites to make a 15 inch pizza you need 15 oz of dough or accordingly my question is should i divide the dough in 9 oz balls before letting them rest and adjust the weight of the dough before forming the pizza or i divide the balls in the weight i need for the size of the pizzas i am making before letting them rest i wanted to hate on and say something negative but actually the video was totally ok and i even gave a thumbs up wtf lol thank you vito awesome video i look forward to making this many times at home piu semplice so since in our household we won t have pizza everyday can you freeze the dough really really nice but maybe you can do a little correction in the video description 1 5 kg would be better than 1500 kg easier to handle i did like that this way is no confusion but i will fix it 0 vito iacopelli your video is great most of us can follow you just fine happy new year i wouldn t worry about that weight i have a pick up truck and it seems that around here that s how much flour we need for all the pizza we actually eat lol why honey you are the pizza god love these videos finally revealing the secrets in your ingredients page correct a small error on the last voice flour 1500kg its a lot of flour to 1 5kg or 1500gr what if i use bread flour it works all the same when i was in napels i had some amazing pizza and it would costs me no more than 6 for a whole pizza so delicious greetings to you all beautiful people https youtu be pyvlzdfrg4i excelente very cute thank you for the effort to teach us pro directions in english too grande chef cercavo giusto una ricetta da fare la mattina e infornare la sera e

cook the dough before adding the cheese orgasmic excellent all good buen simo that was a really fun video such a nice guy i want to visit la to try your restaurant this is bullshit you cant make pizza like this without an oven that is way way way hotter than ny home oven ive been trying this for years it will not happen dont waste your time however i have a trick that i will share in good time its taken me so long im debating even sharing it but ill let you know if i feel generous one of these fine days donal o douling making the dough as instructed can be done at home i do think it would be difficult to get the same results the way it looked in the video not sure why they didn t just use a regular oven they have in the kitchen to show actual results in the video beutiful looking dough its just a shame that i dont have a wood burning oven in my kitchen my oven just cant get a high enough tempreture to cook pizza like that good pizza vito i ve watched a few of your recipes for dough and you usually add just over 3 salt compared to weight of flour this recipe has 25 gr salt to 1500 gr flour or 1 67 it seems it should be more like 45 50 gr salt as compared to your earlier home dough recipe or maybe you found better results with lower salt content just curious as i have found i like the 3 salt content from your previous recipes hey dan did vito ever answer you cause i have the same question 1 58 1500kg of flour a ton and a half nice lots of pizza great job how much sugar should be used instead of honey maestro vito your recipe is brilliant i just made pizza at home using your latest recipe and the technique on your video for three ways to make pizza in home oven i used the method for the stone and the results were excellent thank you keep up the good work it was perhaps the best pizza i ever had thank you again vito thx great video god bless chow after you mix the yeast with luke warm water and then add the honey aren t we supposed to wait 5 to 10 minutes to let the yeast foam up after beginning to eat the sugars yes wallah first time i am able to make good pizza in my house oven thank you so much had to give a dislike because of misleading title i saw the picture and thought this one looks realy original for a home pizza but the pizza is not for at home if you use a pizza ofen even if you cook it low it will never be the same the pizza ofen is like the holy grail all the rest good work well wen i shoot videos for me is more easy to do it at my pizzeria but this is a good point and because this i will make the same video at my home this way you ll see that the product will be almost similar thank you if you use a stone in your oven it gets pretty close vito iacopelli thank you i didn t wanted to be an asshole but there are so many misleading titles on youtube i would have watched the video anyway i belive you that it will be almost similiar what you could do is to make the video in the pizzeria with the pizza ofen and than you can add a short video with the ofen at home and explain the details for people at home than you should put the picture of the home pizza on the thumbnail greez great idea to write the ricetta in diferent languages ed g sorry for my ingles guy claims to be pro then burns the crust lol idiot the crust is supposed to be slightly burnt what kind of wood do you use in your pizza oven made this dough today i might have messed up because i got 8 balls out of it at 250 per but omg the flavor is amazing i cook on a steel but wow another great recipe from vito thanks again how long can i store in the fridge the dough i am glad that you use gloves this pizza look very good vito where can i get that wood mixing dough box what am i doing wrong i ve tried to make this twice now following your exact ingredient measurements and at the first stage and slowly adding the flour into the water and yest a bit at a time i find the dough too watery what am i doing wrong 1000ml of water and 1000g of flour 1500g flour bgdcafe yes but i said the first part which is you put 1000g out of the 1500g of flour in it that has happened to me before i m in a humid environment and i often have to add more flour than my recipes call for to get the dough the right consistency pizza will never be the same without that kind of oven that he is using believe me you need to use a little bit more flour because you live in a high humidity environment probably also make sure you use the right kind of flour all purpose or 00 type just use more flour than the recipe calls for until you have the right consistency apart from that there is 0 chance you will get the same result do you see his oven now look at yours yap thats right even if you put it on max you wont get half the temperature of his oven so the dough wont get into thermal shock the minute you slide it in he also says that you need to use a pizza stone in order to get a passable result then precook the dough with the sauce then take it out put the toppings and cook it again i settled for a different kind of pizza not the traditional italian one as it requires all these things to get it just right and i am pretty happy with the result almost the same recipe for the dough only faster way less fermentation and being able to cook it on a normal stove on max without the need of a pizza stone makes up for the difference in quality if i want to eat a traditional italian one i go to a pizza place and order one the way it should be can u give me that recipe you have been using im also trying my best using the neapolitan method but its not working out as well as i would like but i did just get a pizza stone this week don t add more flour you will f ck up the recipe you have to knead it properly luca emanuel sure man recipe is as follows 1000gr of all purpose or 00 flour i always prefer 00 20gr sugar 20gr salt 1 package of dry yeast 10ml olive oil 600ml water you dissolve the yeast on some warm water just warm not hot or you will kill the yeast around 200ml of the 600ml then you add the sugar and half of the olive oil cover the bowl and let the yeast grow a bit you mix the flour with the salt when the yeast mixture is bubbly you throw it in the flour along with the rest of the water and you knead it until you get an elastic dough you leave dough to rest for 45minutes to an hour until it doubles in size on a warm spot i usually put it in the oven on 30 40 celcius then you cut it in pieces depends how big you want your pizzas and knead it into balls you leave it to rest again for half the time around 20 30 minutes you are ready to make your pizza i bake on a regular oven around 250 270 celcius in a well oiled pan touching the base of the oven at start checking until its ready around 20 minutes usually then placing the pan on a higher spot in the oven decreasing the temperature to 200 220 celsius for the toppings to be perfectly cooked enjoy he adds too much water in his recipe the ideal thing is 1000g flour 600ml water as someone wrote before of course it depends of the humidity of the weather of the area someone lives i always reserve some extra flour in case the dough is too sticky to handle i would also like to add that the more you ferment your dough the better i just made a batch 3 days ago and i slow fermented the dough in the fridge for 2 days and it came out perfect you cover them with plastic wrap leaving some room between them cause they will expand you have to be careful as they must not be exposed to the air the dough has to be covered with plastic wrap and leave some room for it to expand best period is 2 3 days i would not recommend more than 3 days as it will go bad after that period if you have excess dough just cover it in some plastic wrap and throw it in the freezer for future use it should be good to go for a month or so try using yeast instead of yest maybe that s the problem lol well done look great from australia in your video you mention 10 grams of pure honey but in your description it reads 5 grams of honey which is it also you may want to correct the amount of flour 1500kg is over 3000 lbs of flour and how can you say this is home recipe when almost nobody has a wood fire oven they use a stove it would be nice to see the recipe where the pizza is cooked in the oven and at what temperature should be 1 1yeast to sugar if i remember correctly how to activate it 1 gram dry yeast to 1 gram sugar jazagivid istvan bolcs you should google it but i don t think you can go very wrong with 1 1 11 13 mmmm smells wonderful vito what was your temperature in the oven you used i have a brick oven and would like to replicate the same temperature looks riquisimo gracias friend love your content vito thanks i thought the recipe was how to make a pizza at home i don t have a pizza oven it looks great but i wow over 10 hours of waiting i am not this patient great video thanks for sharing great i like it thank you ciao you just got a new subscriber from brazil since i don t have a brick oven i used my own at 350 degrees for 20 to 25 min preheated is this compatible great videos as usual veto i ve watched them all but just one piece of constructive criticism please get a better camera i gather you ve been using the same camera for many years as there has been a dead pixel in the centre right of the screen for much of this time and the lens struggles to find focus your content and presentation is too good to not be preserved in the best possible video quality cheers vito if i use sugar should i decrease the fermentation and proving time less than 6 hours bellissimo vito how many days can i freeze the remaining dough masterclass this 10 hours protocol is perfect preparing dough at breakfast eating pizzas at dinner if you re a restaurant i suppose you make the dough the night before this guy would know vito iacopelli thats a perfect plan i don t wait for a day and use the dough after 2 hours the pizza doesn t bend as good as if the dough would be kept in a fridge for a day but the taste is the same such a long term is needed to dissolve flour fractions in the butter so the dough would be like a solid material but it is not necessary if you aren t going to roll the slice in a tube hehe yep pretty much or you can do it vice versa thank you glad you like it coming soon many many more yes but 10 hours is not fast lol turn your oven to 500 for 5 minutes shut if off put your dough in too proof for 30 minutes it comes out warm and completely proofed ready to be used every time you need time in the morning to let the yeast rise first then knead it that s before the 8hour proofing lord escanor its just not the same read up what is happening in the dough if theres time ciao vito how would you adjust this recipe

resting the dough tutto eccellente wow nice good learning video for the home cook e se abbiamo una temperatura pi bassa di 20 gradi come ci regoliamo con il lievito mi piacerebbe sapere se esiste uno schema per scalare o aumentare il lievito in base alla temperatura e le ore grazie maestro ciao vito complimenti ho un grosso probema il mio impasto si buca o si strappa spesso anche se uso una farina forte per quale raggione il tempo di riposo troppo lungo non credo anche perche tu usi una farina normale con tempi di riposo assai lungo 6 8 ore indebolendo la rete di glutine il che dovrebbe favorire i bucchi e strappi ma no ne vedo dunque ho dei dubbi grazie it is sooooooooo i love pizza perch solo in inglese thanks from south africa for the recipe please we have a gas oven with stones on the bottom and gas burner on the top in my takeaway what would be the best top and bottom temperature for your pizza dough am dying to try it out sir thank you for the knowledge i just started making my own pizza and you seem like an awesome guy i subscribed looking forward to more of your videos thank you vito love your pizza vids i m trying this today 20 c is 68 f not 75 2 oz is 56 g not 50 comparative adjectives fast faster the fastest easy easier the easiest not more easy and not more fast vito doesn t need a pretentious dimwit like you to give him english lessons on comparative adjectives just so you can feel like you actually actually accomplished something great in life by getting through the fourth grade and you can take your ignorant english lesson and put it where the sun don t shine a piece of advice pinhead never correct someone s english unless they ask you to por favor estos videos que nos regala vitto son para aprender de pizzas y como hacer bien las cosas debemos dar las gracias a el y no criticar ni corregir su ingles ademas usted se podria identidicar y poner su nombre y no numeros y letras saludos ciao bravo vito don t overthink it folks with ratios and percents i make this same dough every sunday for years i use a cuisinart food processor so i cut his recipe in half 25 oz of flour all purpose 2 cups of water couple tsp of salt and a pack of dry yeast that s it dissolve the yeast in the water with honey or even a tsp of sugar put the flour and salt in the processor and pour that liquid in slowly with a splash of oil until it looks like pizza dough works every time that box thing is cool but looks like an arm workout thanks vito what temp do you bake how long wow you went professional at 8 years old ciao vito grazie mille per fabuloso video i am practicing my italian can i ask why you use that wooden box what is special about it any info would be greatly appreciated thanks really confused about how much flour i should use i will be using use oo but have no idea the conversion to cups ounces etc can you help me thanks video was great btw don aba thank you easy just get a scale and do it in grams 1 500 kitchen scales are dirt cheap and essential for all things baking i d recommend getting one so as to not be shackled to arbitrary fractions and multiples of cups just ask siri no that s not how you make at the pizza you might as well add the pineapple mike cohen it s a no no 0 i m just kidding but seriously no olive oil in the neapolitan pizza dough i know that you are the miestro i learned lots from you shouldn t we crack the big baloons of the dough cuz after the cook it got burned been making pizza at home for years with guidance from the master bread baker love it che bellisimo maestro iacopelli grazie mille i want to make a pizza with you one day sinore proffesor david come by la you are the best i love your videos vito iacopelli thank you for help us i m from another aide of the earth from turkey and learn with you you are the best some channels suggests high hydrated dough could reach 80 water to flour ratio for home made pizza cause baking pizza in low temperature home oven will take longer time and make pizza dry i care to learn what you think about that thanks for the recipe did you use instant dry yeast or active dry yeast dry yeast instant dried yeast rapid rise yeast but i think this recipe was for the basic home baker and uses regular ol active dried yeast rapid rise at 8 hours at room temp would over proof t r thanks for the reply yes i believe that too so the instant dry yeast is stronger than active dry yeast i have taste issue when i proof my dough for 6 hours using instant dry yeast grazie vito per tutto sei il megliore adoro le tue video baci del norte della francia damn this guy is the god of the pizza love that nicolas now that is a religion i can get behind oh praise vito the pizza god is their a difference if the it s a dry active yeast mostly in flavor live yeast tends to take on a more sourdough type taste and the flavor can be accented with other things thanks thanks for arabic translation 1 kg of flour is 8 cups so i am guessing 1500 kg of flour is wrong m p it s 1 500 gr not sure in cups this is why you should measure in grams or ounces a cup is a vague measure and could vary brendan mcguire she can t say thank you if i was add 1500 kg of flour i don t think i would be able to find my kitchen thanks for the recipe can t wait to try it vito you are the best vito you are confusing the hopeless americans once again with yet another broken english home kitchen simulation fuck you shlomo venezia since you re a self described intellectually challenged hopeless imbecile thanks for the confirmation which you re much too stupid to even understand there s nothing confusing about vito s english and his mistakes are charming you uneducated mothafucking loser ciao vito video interessante come sempre ma vedo che hai messo su un bel po di muscoli sar la pizza con protein powder ciao e grazie giuseppe rinaldetti grazie tante hahahh vito iacopelli ciao vito che farina ai messo la 0 o la 00 bravo vito you re awesome i would ask some friends to help you with your english titles it should read pizza dough to make at home we don t say for the house anyway sei simpatico ahaha ciao bello shushumna ho ok i ll fix it now shushumna language challenged brainless idiot vito s use of english small mistakes included are what makes him authentic and charmingly italian and americans who grew up with english love it god save me from so called perfect english and pretentious uneducated dumbasses like you who think you even know what that is another great video vito vito you said 250g balls but you used 1 5 kg farina 1 liter 1 kg water so its over 2 5kg ingridiens so how you get only 7 pieces of 250g balls which is 1750g the difference in weight is because when you mix them there isn t a direct transfer of weight and the yeast feeds off the starch and sugars yallander ok thanks for info i cant get cruspy and grown edges with home oven tan rico como tu saludos desde la ciudad de mexico it s amazing how you focus about the importance of the different types of yeast their flavors thank you for sharing vito iacopelli i live in africa temps are in the high 30s 40s centigrade our bread dough made with fast active dry yeast rests only about 1hr 2hr will this is be sufficient time for your recipe of pizza dough we built a wood fired clay oven and are workshopping how to make pizza for non profit pizza nights for my charitable organization www togetherwegive net your videos make this possible grazie bello like your videos very much and sense of humor too always the best great job maestro one question could you please make a video about freezing neapolitan pizza dough i personally do a single dough every time i want to have pizza because i live alone but i would like to start making 6 7 dough balls like you do and freeze them after but i don t know when or how before or after proving altrogeruvah i ve frozen dough balls before and i would make sure they prove first that way you just need to take them out of the freezer and let them thaw out then leave them out at room temperature an hour or two before you bake last time i didn t prove them first which meant i needed another few hours to proof them on top of the time for them to thaw so it was just more of an inconvenience thing which defeats the purpose of freezing the dough i guess frank r oh nice thank you so much would it be ok to freeze the dough balls as if after proven and not flatten them out i wouldn t want to compromise the integrity and moisture of the dough balls cause in case something goes wrong it ll be hard to work your way back and fix this altrogeruvah i freeze them as they look just before you flatten shape the pizza so they re slightly puffed up still each one goes into a small plastic freezer bag when you take them out they shouldn t stick to the bag just remove it from the plastic while still frozen and cover either in the fridge or at room temperature if it s not too hot i take out 2 out a time and each one gets its own plate and is covered with a bowl personally i prefer pre cook pizzas with only tomato sauce and now you can freeze it once you need one is almost ready just put mozzarella cheese and what else you want and cook until is ready gr ssoft yes good idea once you have the oven on you can cook all your bases then defrost them whenever you need add the toppings fresh and probably some more fresh tomato afterwards as well frank r thank you i ll be doing exactly that next time this is the way to go gr ssoft yes this is interisting and i will make a video soon vito iacopelli great thanks i m curious to see what the best way would be to prepare and freeze pizza dough or prebaked bases vito iacopelli thank you vito i m sure a lot people will wait this video sicuramente saranno in tanti ad aspettare questo video grazie vito iacopelli thanks vito looking forward to it vito iacopelli please make a close up video on how to shape a pizza with our hands when i try to use my hands the pizza becomes deformed and sometimes holes appear normally i use a rolling pin but for neapolitain style rolling pin is no good cannot produce that crust thanks maestro and i love all your videos i wonder how long you pre cook a pizza dough with tomato sauce thanks i wonder how long to pre cook a pizza dough with only tomato sauce thanks if you wanna freezing the dough you can follow the same way without adding the dry yeast that will give you more time to keep the dough in freezer and u can add little bit sugar instead of the honey as well if u like to both are working good vito iacopelli u r amazing absolutely loved when u gave correct measurements no video on the net do that hi from india i haven t tried this recipe however when i have left over dough i just put a little flour on it pop it a zip lock bag freezer bag and stick it in the freezer in the am i set it on the counter in a bowl open the bag cover it with plastic wrap and a towel keep it from drying because it will rise a bit and in the evening spread it and make the pizza not as great as the first one but pretty good see if that works for you thanks for sharing i m going to prova when i m in la for sure love your video s hope your family is doing well i have a 70 cmx70 cm pizza party wood burning oven from naples super vito you are a real maestro congrats to you and your team at prova please is possible for the traduction in french description because big communauty thx maestro and sorry for my english que veux tu savoir car je suis pizzaiolo m me je comprends pas ma langue italienne mais je comprends le protocole when you think you have not enough dough just let it rest and wait for it d oh man that pizza looks amazing even with a lower temperature in your wood oven the result will never be the same in a regular oven have you tried the broiler to stovetop method or stovetop to broiler method in my experience it s the only way to get a nice char on the crust and the underside of the pizza if you don t have a wfo wood fired oven get a kettle bbq and a cast iron cooking stone rkmugen we just recently started finishing the pizza on the stove we don t broil in the oven just cook at 450f or so until top is done and crust is somewhat cooked then we finish the crust in a pan on the stove we also occasionally pre bake the crust if we feel the dough needs it he literally states in the video that if you are doing it home you should precook it victor vanderlinde and so what lightman 3d it means that i do not disagree with you my comment is stupid lol thanks vito awesome video do you have a prova at chicago very good nice t shirt thank you for showing the recipe with dry yeast it is hard to find fresh yeast now i can make your pizza actually this is very nice dough especially for the house but i find that with the dry yeast 6 8 hours is a lot of time to ferment it really over ferments i did it for 4 4 5 hrs and it really turns out perfect depends on ur climate room temp too just adjust accordingly or maybe you used warmer water than he did temp of room water ammount of salt etc all influence yeast it also depends on the amount of yeast you use the less the better as it takes longer to ferment but it will be lighter when you eat it the standard bag in the uk is 7g of dry yeast comparable to 25g of fresh cube available in italian shops bear in mind the original recipe says you need only 3g of fresh yeast for 1 8 kg of flour allowing the same minimum 8 hours of fermentation still at higher room temperature as in south of italy more for colder climate imagine the very little equivalent quantity of dry yeast you would need i believe he boosted the quantity here and using honey to make it even faster still awesome video especially for italian emigrates that can only order fresh yeast online thx perche no italiano adesso maestro thank you very much for this video this is what i have been waiting for vito you are the best i love all of your videos i bought my own oven and i am teaching my grandsons how to make with it now i can recreate the pizza i had so many times in naples italy with my family thank you maestro vito iacopelli thank you vito its great to see you how you doing please may i take a moment of your time thanks vito you open my eyes because in an old italian cook book i have here in uk a lady says to cook my pizza at 230c for 15 mins then 190c for 10 mins more i noticed its mostly over cooked yet now after watching you its better to just cook the pizza with sauce for say the 15 mins then add toppings buffalo mozzarella anvhovies fresh basil i have been putting olive oil my pizza tray for cooking olive oil top of pizza dough before sauce olive oil on topped ready for bake pizza generally being generous with olive oil do you have much thoughts on the use of good olive oil i appreciate it from craig lee white good bye where did you get that box i am looking for one dan castle online i will send you the link dan youthfultrends com thanks vito you re the best also interested in the link to buy the wooden box vito iacopelli i would love to buy that box as well sir check maidda siciliana vito iacopelli could you send me the link for the wooden box please sei un grande continua cosi please give us the reciepe of tomate sauce with frech tomatoes already on his channel dan castle ok thank you number 1 pizza in la grazie amico vito iacopelli vito you re in la where santa monica blvd west hollywood vito iacopelli i m going to head out there sometime soon for a slice or even a pie originally from ny so i like great pizza do they also deliver in the netherlands i m curious about the quality that would be a great experience volvo v40 guess from la to the netherlands it ll be cold when reaching you which isn t saying much decent pizza i guess and pretty good for california honey in pizza dough neapolitans will kill you for this vito hahah not really they love me 0 and i love them no is just because helps the fermentation and the cooking you ll see on the video vito iacopelli graze for the response vito ciao lelwat it s more common than you d think the yeast feeds on the honey and it s a better alternative to sugar some also use molasses how long does it rest for 6 8 hours couple of days vito iacopelli 6 8 hours couple of days which is the recommended one a couple of days is a bit too much it should be maximal 24 hours rest 18 hours is normal rest in naples pizzerias but a long rest requires plastic wrap or the dough gets too dry outside i finally made the dough in a very easy way all the ingredients you can find it in your local store and the nice thing i use the dry yeast for this recipe i hope you like it it come out perfect comment here what you think about this dry yeast what s the wight or the balls 250 300 grams alan kirby 250 grams vito iacopelli thanks this video tutorial is genius subscribing to your channel now merry christmas ciao vito bellissimo supportarti si vede che sei pieno di passione superb video do you use mineral water high or low ph does it make a difference if i make this at home on what temperature to do it awesome can these be freezes for later use vito iacopelli can we freeze it vito why is the oil and salt added in second stage why not immediately at the beginning with mixing i want to know thanks the oil and salt tard the action of the yeast somewhat so it s often more satisfactory to add these ingredients once the hydrated dough has been given a chance to allow the yeast to get going first alexandre pizarro if i plan to use the dough for the next 2 3 days i put it in the fridge if i need to use it later i put it in the freezer can i use instant yeast as i cant find ried yeast also what was the other pizza you made i tried lots of differents doughts for a home oven only 250 c for me this receipe is the best with caputo floor and dry beer yeast with 8 hours rest the dought is already good to be used perfectly and i use your technic i put tomatoes in the oven after few minutes i put the rest of ingredients and in oven thank you dude you rock how about a recipe for three or 4 pizzas can we just half everything including amount of yeast or won t that work great videos really love your channel duro novak with 1 ball 250gr 4x250gr 1000gr 600gr of flour 400gr of water 1000gr proportionnality works perfectly fantastico vito great work i used 3 ingreidents there are some bubbles on the surface after 7 hours is that good grazie hello sir did you use warm water thanks halil akcengiz sure bubbles are good they are telling you that yeast are working fine and gluten have developed nicely take a look closer to the video when comes to stretching there is huge bubble in the middle of the dough hmmmm but the biga dough is where it s at tho sunny salt is not good for yeast it can kill the yeast question about the ingredients are oil and honey mandatory in the dough are these used by local pizzeria i am asking because i though normally pizza should be just flower salt and yeast one question would be ok to freeze the dough balls after the 8h fermentation will it come out good still thanks for the video i will try it i m more into wet yeast yet i have to say that your pizza is reaaaaaaallly good hi vito you ve been a big inspiration to my pizza cooking for a while now i got ooni pizza ovens and i ve tried many of your dough recipes awesome as it s winter in finland i need to make my pizza inside i tried this recipe and actually made a video out of it check this out https youtu be xhh2u8m9pqe let me know how i did keep up the good work best regards from cold finland mikko projectboxi sunny many chefs and bakers believe that adding salt to the yeast in first stage will hurt it and affect the texture and the taste or bread or pizza so they add it in second stage hope this will help koko roko bake it at 550 f or 500 f and it won t take long time to be baked if you don t have that temperature put it on the highest in your oven that was the best dough wow likearolling no try to pre make all the pizzas at this stage and freeze like that so ready to then take out and cook thank you for your expertise in making the dough i always use dry yeast as there isn t the cake yeast wet available anywhere near me i look forward to more videos you ve made https youtu be mn1br8qgkh8 this is the best method for me so far the preferment great idea thanks maestro i freeze a little dough every time i make some just make sure you freeze after proofing but before stretching alexandre pizarro i think this is a great video for home pizza mr vito can you please tell if all purpose flour you use is the same as plain flour for the uk folks cause i was told that use bread flour for pizza i tried this exactly like he said the dough came out very pale white which means it was over fermented or not enough sugar honey its the sugar which browns the crust in conventional ovens any help appreciated what about the ingredients for 1 or 2 pizzas thanks i tried out your recipe and technique combined with your business dough technique absolutely spot on thanks a million the pizza dough cooked perfectly on a lava stone in my oven at 500f the crust came out airy and crisp with soft crumb inside just like your video the stretching technique produced thin base with crust on edge only needed to cook 6 to 7 minutes and voila perfect pizza i used some of dough at 3 hours of proofing and the other after6 hour proofing at room temp and rest of proofing in fridge over night longer proof produced even better results great v deo one more i ve learnt a lot i ll try this recipe on next weekend greetings from brazil sunny if you pay attention vito made a 100 hydratation dough and he let it rest for 1h after what he added the salt the oil and the rest of the flour this is a pre fermentation technique also used in bakery it allows a better fermentation and give a better elasticity to the dough the salt slow down the action of the yeast so you don t want to add it during the pre fermentation the oil is added only once the dough is formed because if you mix fat with flour it may prevent the forming of the gluten it s the principle of the shortcrust pastry vito does this process works for a gluten free flour as well can i keep the rest of the dough in the freezer dima hh scale it down proportionally the recipe should make roughly 10 x 250g dough ball 1000g water 1500g flour 100g water 150g flour for each dough ball is the yeast being used here active dry yeast or instant yeast vito for how long did you knead the dough looks awesome making it today vito iacopelli you may put 2 eggs one the dough and no sugar wondering it is normal eater to activated the yeast or just normal water ciao quanto deve cuocere nel forno di casa lightman500 thanks lightman500 when you say longer proof produced even better results i take it you had good results proofing some of your dough in fridge overnight vs 6 8 hrs at room temp just made a full batch and i am going to experiment with bulk fermenting all the dough in the fridge for about 3 4 days after the two 1 hour rests then i ll ball it while it s cold and put it in separate lightly oiled containers keep in the fridge freezer and bring to room temp when about to stretch and cook so glad i saw your video just now it s brilliant thanks writing it in my book now just to say reading your english recipe below the arrow today there is a typo it says 1500kg it should say 1500g or 1 5kg thanks again sunny i believe salt can inhibit yeast vito iacopelli for how much time we have to bake at home vito iacopelli if i will use bread flour will i still use the same amount of water and flour as stated in your recipe also can i make this recioe without kneading like those no knead recipe all over the internet thanks love this recipe quick question if would cold ferment this dough for 48hrs would that increase the quality of the pizza where do i get one of those wood boxes sunny salt retards and sometimes kills the yeast always activate it without salt potlovingchef14 ap flour usa equal plain flour in uk or use 00 flour or strong bread flour jesse aboagye i think active dry i have been asking the same thing vito iacopelli can i freeze the extra dough in the freezer how about if i let it ferment for longer time is it ok that s a lot of flour 1500g i hope can i ask what the oven temperature is for this recipe and why the oil sugar is used for home doughs ok i made this video very easy to make and fast and i explain it everything step by step the flour is not a lot is perfect you ll see the temperature was low the oil is to make the dough more fragrant and help to cook and the honey is basically to help the fermentation and the color of the pizza vito iacopelli check out dry malt i use that in my dough and get a beautiful browning on 550 with steel in top and bottom of oven love your videos by the way and will definitely stop into provo if out your way i m in ny thank you prova vito iacopelli i m sorry that was typeo prova most traditional recipes are scaled from 1 litre of water whereas if you use 1 kilo of flour since that s what the flour comes packaged as usually then you can pick the amount of water i usually go with 650mls vito will correct me if i m wrong but i think the lower temperature of a home oven means a higher level of hydration will help the dough not to dry out and the oil helps with some browning martin using sugar and oil is pretty standard for a ny style pizza dough i ve played with different recipes at home but my standard is ny style as dan castle indicated using a pizza steel at home will deliver fantastic results i use a lodge cast iron pizza pan it s not as heavy as the 14x16 pizza steels at 0 25 inches thick but it gets hot and delivers a lot of heat to the dough my crust beats the heck out of most pizza restaurants which is why i started mastering the craft tired of sub standard garbage pizza frank r thanks for the info frank i was tongue in cheek referring to the typo in the recipe above showing 1500 kg of flour yes the higher hydration accounts for the longer cook time causing more evaporation the use of oil puzzled me does it help dough structure crust softness browning or just flavour as vito said also is the sugar necessary if the proving time is longer i understand it would be helpful for flavour and browning if it is still present during cooking but the fermentation would have used it up if left for longer tyronebiggums3 thanks i use a stone at my ovens max temp but still have trouble getting a light pillowy crust with leopard spotting is this just an issue using home ovens i was hoping that using the oil sugar was a solution but perhaps not martin gallacher ahh yes ok i worked that out afterwards i just read it as grams i ve seen other people say the oil helps with browning i don t use any i have a cast iron skillet that i leave on the gas burner then stick it under the grill broiler and you can get some nice browning that way and a decent char on the base too not perfect but worth a try i used to have a little video on my instagram page but no longer or else i d point you there martin gallacher i don t attempt to achieve what s possible in a wood fired even but check out serious eats
