white stuff i can t find that sauce any where i like it doesn t look as watery thanks vito tomayto sas and baysil sure its tomato basil never mind perfect simple and delicious da me su 100 grammi di pomodori pelati mettono 1 grammo di sale quindi su 7 500 kg mettiamo 75 grammi di sale thanks vito maybe buy a longer blender what the white stuff he put in inside that did not look like salt i had flour quality salt makes a pyramid shape on a spoon that was straight edges never saw salt like that he never said what it was he mistakenly called it sauce but most assume it was salt after just 40 seconds we need sea salt nina tomatoes are best i ever had even better than di napoli which is a god sauce san marzano style and san marzano are not the same grown under vesuvius is real san marzano some tomatoes grown outside san marzano are as good but very few california grown are not close its like champagne vs sparkling wine except being in san marzano is actually important volcanic soil real san marzano tomatoes have a serial number and certification the can grocery stores charge arm and leg but some wholesale costo clubs have large can much cheaper nina is a good brand i trust this guys opinion he knows pizza no doubt great video he is a great teacher explains well simple is better hey vito was that salt sugar or cheese you put in there every friday i make pizza this friday it will be even better thanks vito i am kalai vani from india i want to start shop in chennai i am a big fan for ur piza recepi pl guide me less is more bravo that s exactly how i was thought ny style bruh that s napoli style like he says whenever i do this at home the sauce comes out a bit sour acidic and nothing like the sauce i get in professional pizza restaurants sure i add a little sugar but i still haven t managed to make a great pizza sauce at home check the ingredients on the label citric acid is often added as acidity regulator perhaps this is the source of acidic taste good brands contains 100 of tomatoes and san marzanos are the top notch edit and better not to blend as shown in the movie use your hands to smash the tomatoes because blending spoil the seeds which will give the bitter acidic taste they use blender because using hand would be time consuming for the home purposes do it the right way mrblackigel excellent thanks i ll see if i get find better canned tomatoes simple and looks delicious i plan to make pizza this weekend and will use your dough and sauce recipes although i m going to have reduce the amount of the recipe otherwise i ll have enough pizza for the entire neighborhood thanks for sharing thank you are those tomatoes in puree or juice which one do you recommend thanks vito hey hi thanks so much for this recipe just for info we call this blander a hand mixer grazie 8bit time traveler i mean there is a huge difference between a hand blender and a hand mixer so i m curious why would you call this a hand mixer can t i use the san mozzanos from my garden i got the seeds from italy no i definitely can not honzaj why not i love this guy looks amazing no effort into the art of making something from scratch mix it in a can is how much they care about the customer good enough is good but not great was looking for a good insight in how to make a sauce above the rest or how to make a good enough sauce to sell pizza so i ll just experiment on my own thanks for teaching me on what not to do we add one nice scoop of tomato sauce huh was that salt sugar or baking soda just try rat poison it was sea salt greatness in simplesity are u located in the usa or italy he use a white ingredient what is it please do i understand you do not cook the sauce more than it is already cooked when canned 2 20 i never seen white granulated tomato sauce before beautiful vito great to be learning from the maestro what is the difference between san marzanos tomatoes and other brands where i live i can t get that brand and i really want to try this sauce out ty perfect awesome video thank you so awesome and inspiring to have you teach me how to make pizza thanks for taking the time to share you are awesome question how about if a person shreds or chops up the basil into fine bits b 4 adding to sauce also how about garlic and some onion powder let me know and thank you i cook my pizza sauce from fresh tomatoes out of my mother s garden i dare any bet that my sauce is a lot better than this unless your mother lifes on the vesuvius and grows her own fresh san marzano tomatoes i dare say that canned san marzano tomatoes can keep up the ones used in the video are san marzano style not the real deal i ll take the bet thank you again americans still think their pizza and pizza sauce is authentic come on this is a perfect simple tomato sauce for pizza will it work for spaghetti or course not that is why it s called pizza sauce oh also for calzone if that s your thing to make tomato sauce you need tomato sauce no brainer right there was that salt or sugar that s disgusting he stuck his finger in it throw up then what are you waiting for commenting i see some people cook the tomato sauce first and i see some people just use it uncooked and let it cook on the pizza i guess i will make two pizzas one with cooked tomato sauce and one with uncooked tomato sauce to check for any differences nathan plis tell me the answer when you are done would like to know as well thanks thanks i asked how you did this on another of your videos seems like more than a teaspoon of salt and the tomatoes will have lots of salt in the can still its for americans not good tomato sauce the basile is not dice and is not working subscribed you re a very friendly and competent man hallo bekommt man diese dosen di napoli auch in deutschland zu kaufen hello can you buy these tins di napoli also in germany salve potete acquistare queste lattine di napoli anche in germania san marzano style and san marzano dop products aren t really the same thing in my opinion but if vito makes his pizza sauce with stanislaus di napoli tomatoes they must be damn good everything vito does is well thought out and nothing he does is by accident this guy knows what he s doing the stanislaus broker is trying to get us to try this tomato product and i just might after seeing this stop saying so again you ve surpassed my expectations great great presentation thank you the best pizza is always simple as a former chef i know for a fact that the more ingredients there are in a recipe the more chance there is to screw it up additionally simple recipes are usually just better listen to this guy he knows what he s doing i d been screwing up my pizza and i watched one of his videos now after 1 small adjustment i make better pizza than any restaurant in my town what was your adjustment i been enjoying learning making my own recently can you translate to arabic good and basic trick is always use good tomatoes i make few different types of pizza sauce sometimes i cook the sauce too i fry it in olive oil it makes sweeter sauce but most of the time i make sauce like his but i add a pinch of black pepper and a lil garlic thats it nothing more i use fresh tomatoes cooked them remove skin baked in olive oil with garlic and rosmarijn and sea salt piment and add some water why you dont use fresh tomatoes for my taste they are 500 better than canned you can but will take hours to cook tomatoes down sacrilegio mai frullare i pomodori si dovrebbero sbriciolare con le mani o passere col passaverdure teaspoon you must have big teacups that is a table spoon pathetic i am neapolitan and i was taught to use a bit of olive oil in the tomato sauce why don t you use it i am just curious thank you for the interesting video oil in tomato sauce will rise to the top and you have to mix it alot over again in big batches also in his video he tends to add the oil before and or after cooking the pizza gristle von raben true but when you add a bit of oil to your sauce and mix it well so that still stays in emulsion the sauce will have a brighter color pizza is also eaten with the eyes netkomm excellent point some people will always miss the point thx vito for showing this way of doing a quick no fuss tomato sauce i like the idea of not cooking the sauce but a little confused with you not adding anything oregano onions garlic salt sugar etc do those tomatoes have anything in them straight from the can i m assuming no cooking with the kingfish the sauce is all about freshness simplicity making pizza at home is just about experimenting and doing as you wish finding things you like or don t like lucali cooks their tomato sauce with similar ingredients you mention and i believe di fara also cooks the sauce they use others use just pure tomatoes like in this video which is fine as well sugar 1 4 1 5 tablespoon 1 4 1 5 thanks vito you always make me look like a professional keep up the good work this guy is an idiot thank you you to ciao vito appena torno a los angeles vengo a provare la tua pizza una domanda dove lo trovi il lievito fresco lievito di birra qui in america grazie interesting that the folks from bon appetit youtube channel did a lot of research and came up with using the same exact tomatoes i have to find them this recipe was way too technical for me love u with all my respect for u dinapoli that s what liguria bakery san francisco uses to make the very best foccacia on the planet leave it to italians to make a bland boring flavorless sauce and charge you money for garbage ask a greek if you want something really good less is more einstein less is more einstein george so show us or you re just another gobshite if you can t figure out you need a can opener va fangoule wonderful super simple no cooking thanks where is your pizza shop san marzano stlye isnt san marzanano its a knock off you worked so hard on that sauce you don t get the seeds out duuuuude not cool my friend sauce it s still really good 0 it s not fresh tomatoes how to make sauce pizza saudi arabin plz im italian greeks love you maestro the king is this a recepie thanks vito i was thinking wtf why is he buying california tomatoes in italy then i did some research and see he has a restaurant in la lol disappointed he s using california tomatoes san marzano tomatoes are unique because of the volcanic soil and the altitude where they grow using an immersion blender also a big disappointment should be broken up by hand in a bowl not with a blender in a can the basil should be bout before putting in the sauce the blender bruises the basil badly and destroys the best flavor look at italia squisita videos to see how it s supposed to be done this isn t bad for a restaurant that serves lots of people but it could be better great videos and i m a big fan i can t go along with cooking pizza sauces make taste like spaghetti with a name like vito iacopelli you just know the pizza sauce is gonna be good so you recommend great italian sauce from california fuckin stupid prat one nice scoop of tomato sauce what the fuck are you talking about that s white stuff on the scoop not tomato sauce i m guessing you meant salt or even sugar very confusing you are holding a teaspoon of white powder on a teaspoon this could be salt or sugar but you are saying it s a teaspoon of tomato sauce which you then add to a tin of san marzano tomatoes so what was the white stuff on the spoon salt sugar or tomato sauce as you said it was terrible video totally confusing and hard to understand your pigeon english stick to cooking grazie i love the concept i love what you are making i love italian food what s throwing me is the california tomatoes this is not a criticism just questioning if you grind the seeds too the sauce will taste bitter what about garlic and some seasoning ma quanto sale hai meso thumbs up vito ciao may be the italians found the pizza but the other nations made it better darling that tomato sos that simple doesn t test like any shit sorry was that a teaspoon of salt you put in the canned tomatoes i couldn t understand thank you very simple and great taste thanks a lot could not understand half of what he said the white stuff he put in tomato cans sounded like sauce salt salono one nice scoop of tomato sauce don t you mean salt he meant salt or sale in italian i wish he would take the extra 2 minutes and say this amount of salt x number of grams per x size grams of tomato san marzano style however you can just taste it yourself and decide if it s right for you it s a pretty simple recipe thank you vito for sharing your delicious secret recipe sauce with us the problem with italians is that they think they re white explain it better my friend vito iacopelli italians are not white drop of olive oil in the sauce goes a long way nice job very simple bravo chef add a teaspoon adds a normal spoon that is a teaspoon moron jonathan eperson heaped tablespoon by the look probably 20ml or more tsp is 5ml god knows what your food tastes like if you use that much very time a recipe calls for a teaspoon moron he is right for a quick canned sauce this brand is high quality does this tomato sauce work well with pizzas made in home ovens lower temperature max 250c degrees ethnoeuropean s countriesarebeinginvaded yes don t cook it in a it cooks in the oven you can mix it the night before add some whole crushed garlic cloves over night in glass jar or bowl not metal take them out before using never precook sauce once in the oven just l8ke he did it is all you need or it gets overcooked don t worry youll be okay has another video for home made kitchen pizzas the dough but i think too much oil and olive it will be too soft for you a spoon of regular veg oil use half all purpose half bread if you can in america no g arthur organic or arrowhead mills 000 triple 0 is very soft flour you can use cake flour in america its finely ground or pastry triple 0 you get in salamerias italian markets in a italian neighborhood if you lived in nyc is tell you exactly were to go if you can get tomatoe passtas in jars great mutti is a great brand still i don t know were you live what you get cento is nation wide in america is good so is pastene don t get redpack ever its garbage the grind skin seeds its horrible i dont use it even for free maybe soup but nothing italian nothing else its bitter ethnoeuropean s countriesarebeinginvaded you need high temp go look 4 pizza home made here he gives advice but like i said too much oil read what i said about oil unfortunately i live in sweden p but i ll test till i ll get a good result ormai faccio la salsa di pomodoro cos anch io a casa vista l impossibilit di trovare una salsa di pomodoro decente qui in california l unico difetto che ho trovato per questo approccio che tende ad andare a male un po pi in fretta della salsa normale ma basta mangiarla prima grazie molte per il video e per l idea per me funziona benissimo mi hai salvato dal concentrato di pomodoro da ricostituire a pseudo salsa di pomodoro del trader joe s brrr le salse di pomodoro al supermercato hanno una lista di ingredienti di una pagina e non ne esiste una senza cipolla disidratata aggiunta pare e la pom per qualche oscuro motivo qui costa una fortuna trovo la mutti al world s market ma questa fatta coi pelati si trovano anche buoni meglio e costa meno il che non guasta i m very weary about adding salt to the sauce it s so acidic the way it is i gave dislike because here in india we don t get canned tomatoes vito i remember you when you were at michael s keep up the good work buddy chao the most passionate pizzamaker that i ve ever saw very nice great video but i have a question regarding the way you blend the tomatoes when you use a blender like in the video are you not going to blend the tomato seeds as well blended seeds are very acid and bitter i imagine and would give the tomato sauce a high level of bitterness grande vito grazie gordon ramsay and jamie oliver can suck my dick great video that s exactly what i m after grazie mille fratello mio great video this is a really basic bitch sauce ok so what do you need to make tomato sauce you need tomato saaauce lol whut vito fantastico your channel is my bible what are your thoughts about putting the blended tomatoes into a sieve and removing excess water i bet jeff is happy for the extra marketing sei un grande soprattutto quando dici take care to don t tagli cut your hand vito great job thank you for sharing your passion with us

selbstgemachte tomatenso e aus der dose ja dazu muss man wahrlich win sternekoch sein under win youtube video drehen troll i used to make like this tomatto sauce for pizza nepolitana seems so difficult but i ll give it a try a 6 min video to open a can add some salt and basil and whizzzz it how stupid does he imagine the viewers are bleander i watch this everytime i eat pizza lol thank you for sharing sam marzano and sam marzano style definitely not the same thing and you sound like you re from italy i am shocked and you sound like an idiot i am not shocked sarplaninac13 now who sounds like an idiot title fair play it take a top chef to open a tin and blend it i must be a master in my kitchen was that salt or suger you put you didnt say salt no garlic no oregano no olive oil hey vito if you believe in youreself others will too i love italian fireworks cars cigars food all good thanks ciao grazi a few concerns here i wouldnt use usa tomatoes not as good as proper branded italian tomatoes secondly the blender tends to break the seeds resulting in some bitterness in napoli they blend by hand otherwise his methodology is correct viva italia in the beginning he said ciao then i closed the video bye vitooo voglio venire a lavorare con te a los angeles c posto those cans are freaking huge so for a regular can how much salt and you say tea spoons but using table spoons s 1 by weight prefer not to use a bleander lol but really it emulsifies the sauce crush that shit by hand gives it more character improve the flavor by adding garlic powder onion powder oregano and light sugar you re welcome great recipe man wife and kids loved it where exactly are you located in west hollywood tho need to try those amazing pizzas you make look so damn deliciois this looks like a high school culinary project i guess every cook makes their pizza sauce different when i make my sauce i dont add any of the water in the can just the tomatoes itself which will result in a thicker bolder flavor along with basil oregano and evvo i learned a lot from vito keep up the good work bello gratis aldo what s evvo matthew schellenberg extra virgin olive oil grazie 1000 per il tuo video semplice e sempre il migliore saluti dal messico grazie per aver condiviso i tuoi video con tutti gli appassionati di pizza san marzano style plumb tomatoes deceptive packaging that s like writing cadillac style crappy car san marzanos are plum tomatoes saying they are san marzano style is a way of saying they are the same or similar variety as san marzano at a lower cost this recipe seems so absurdly simple it couldn t possibly be good but it is and it has changed my life i bought an immersion blender just to try it but i used cento brand instead since that what i can get thank you vito who s this guy forget about it thank you for sharing with us i made this sauce but i added garlic and pesto it came out delicious bel video as a home cook i wouldn t use that much sauce what would be the ratio of salt to smaller cans of tomatoes and in your educated opinion is cento a good brand of tomatoes that sauce is so good i want to drink it great video use a gallon of gin with the leftovers to make a pail of bloody mary please don t stick your fingers in the sauce if you re going to serve it to people that s disgusting simon i wonder what the difference is between sticking a finger in sauce is to stretching dough with your hands just wondering i don t think a lot doh this video was awesome it s so amazing that the most delicious things are so simple it s always entertaining to look at italian food videos b c the comments are always so ferocious here is what i understand italy is like the usa meaning every state has a different style and way of doing things there is no single italian way just what you did and that s cool let other people do it their way too thanks vito for showing me your way and helping me have a great dinner with my family are you serious you not supposed to blend it inside a tin can you idiot this guy is an idiot there is nothing about the sauce oregano and olive oil no very basic sauce with bad instruction one spoon of tomato sauce one tea spoon what is it salt it s salt lol through me for a spin too i ve a tomato garden in the back shoud i buy the tomato can and not use my organic tomatoes or organic is bad for health i don t know the size of those can because the look very big and that white stuff was it sugar the tomatoes came from californai wtf i d say chances are big that the tomatoes actually came from the netherlands and they were only grown and canned in california thank you for your piece of pizza advice i ll take your italian ciao and raise you with an asian chop chop subbed can you blend those tomatoes up in a traditional blender san marzano tomatoes from california they re cheaper so they make more money thank you for your videos i enjoy watching i m not gay but i still want to fuck this guy come fare la salsa apre delle latte di salsa pronta genio incompreso really nice san marzano style ma per favore poi uno pseudo pizzaiolo che frulla basilico e il pomodoro dice tutto almeno non dire che sono prodotti italiani question how to make the cheese for pizza does not look like it would be that good too bland cooked sauce with oregano plus basil and garlic is better that is ny style with oregano california style san marrzano is not the real stuff well console yourself by remembering that tomatoes came first from the americas ma ke testa di cazzo ma come cazzo parli i needed this channel years ago what temperature should i use for my 1 16 pizza i have a gas oven i get hungry ever time i watch your videos pasquale as hot as it will go thought it was going to be from scratch thank you for this so its just good tomato salt fresh basil i was stressing so much bout a good saus and what herbs to use to make it taste like pizza so i seen the dough and saus and i will try it nedt weekend greetings from the netherlands yeah me too also for basic italian speghetti its just a 1 4 to 1 2 cup of smashed garlic lightly browned in olive oil more like yellowed then canned tomatoes whole crushed by hand and put into the pan to bubble and boil for a minute or two add sea salt to slight salt taste remember salt is hard to undo it was from a cooking show and its delicious to get it to stick to pasta add a 1 4 cup of the used pasta water pre salted as you boil it to the thickness you want no il minipimer no a mano hola vito aqui con tigo title 1 aheaping tablespoon of salt youtube reading my mind just watched the how to make pizza video and was wondering about the tomato sauce voila presto but vito when you teach make sure you speak the proper ingredient while you re adding it one scoop of sea salt for every container of tomato sauce you said one scoop of tomato sauce for tomato sauce just to help the slow people thanks without cooking it ok but without olives oil and thyme big sorry u know nothing about pizza sauce chef thanks so much for the di napoli tomato recommendation i make sauce tonight with di napoli and it turned out very well certainly fine restaurant quality i usually grow my own tomatoes for sauce but run out every year at this time di napoli comes pretty close to home grown as the tomatoes are grown near los banos and canned there i grow tomatoes in in my backyard santa clara county i need to warn you about the amount of salt your putting in your pizza sauce each 102 oz can of di napoli has already 220 mg of salt for every serving 25 5 servings per large can for a total of 5610mg it looks like you are adding about a quarter cup of salt per 102 oz can of di napoli tomatoes that is approximately 67 800 mg the total amount of salt is 73 410 mg per can divide that by 25 5 servings and that is a whopping 2 879 mg of salt per 4 oz serving you use at least of cup 8 oz of sauce on each of your individual pizzas the maximum amount of salt an individual should have per day is 2400mg before health problems start to appear ti do un consiglio puoi fare la stessa cosa anche con le mani come dice la tradizione napoletana no garlic dude you are not using san marzano tomatoes canned san marzanos when grown in the valle del sarno valley of the sarno in italy in compliance with italian law can be classified as pomodoro s marzano dell agro sarnese nocerino and have the eu dop emblem on the label i couldn t make out what that white stuff was he added sugar or salt any special tomatoes needed or simply what aviable hey bambino iffa you don wanna cutta your hands cutta da lid offa completely anybody who in the comment section below criticized the accuracy and rather clever attributes of this recipe for making neapolitan style pizza sauce for a home oven in conjunction with sig iacopelli s neapolitan style pizza dough recipe for the home oven should do two things 1 watch davide civitiello s italia squisita youtube video on the same exact topic then 2 apologize to sig iacopelli he clearly knows his stuff better than any of you ever will and he was willing to share his knowledge as best he could in your language without being a pretentious snob la ringrazio per tutto maestro wow thank you so so much unfortunately not everyone understands what i m doing here i m just trying to help someone for free and in a simple way and they don t appreciate it it s ok one day they will vai forza ragazzo the correct way to prepare the tomato sauce for the pizza is to add 1 salt to the tomato not anyhow and most important to process the tomato by hand only any other way will affect the taste of the tomato leaving behind a sense of acidity that in the industry then they correct adding sugar so clever francis i am avpn trained so i know what i am talking about basil and oil are optional according to taste but always by hand the most acceptable alternative would be a vegetable mill with large holes the idea is not to crush the tomato seeds vito iacopelli only a lazy wop would make pizza sauce like this disgusting method thank you for the recipe but i think this all could be explained also in an one minute video adding salt is not as complicated as it shown here take care its called the 1st amendment and who is attacking this guy its just pizza sauce use some of that offensive criticism towards something that really matters now i want pizza vito iacopelli don t care about haters vito im watching you for a years vito iacopelli and you rock at it keep up the good work and thanks a lots for sharing your knowledge because of you now i am able to make better dough for pizza and sauce as well you are my teacher vito iacopelli so whithout oil why thank you netkomm vafanapoli robert curtis robert curtis the poster child for what happens when brothers and sisters decide to conceive a child i ll spell it out for you jethro you call your brother and sister mom and dad too don t you inbred francis mcgarry well said francis thank you vito iacopelli hey thanks for what you do do you notice a big taste difference between the d o p san marzano tomatoes vs the san marzano type style you are using here thx again robert curtis a lazy what you sir are a real ass jerk1 netkomm you are just ridiculous it s 3kg can if you take 1 of 3kg you have 30gr and if you use oz and cups it s hilarious to want to play precision which must be close to this giant generous spoon the man grinds the tomatoes to a minimum just to keep different textures in the sauce you just decided to hate this video now go sulk somewhere else gutin nec i am not sure what you know about making pizza i am doing that for the past 25 years and i am trained and certified pizzajolo so unless you want a product that is inconsistent and acidic then you better be precise but hey i am not the one eating your pizza being precise and being consistent is matter of being professional and respecting your client netkomm pizzajolo okay do you import your mozzarella from italy is she from buffalo is it used in the day it was made the only way to do that is to live in the heart of italy then if it s to dictate the rules and only be able to follow half of them even in italy some pizza people are starting to leave the pizza federations because they behave like a mafia instead of thinking with common sense when it comes to selling you a mozzarella there s no problem that it s 15 days old while everywhere they say it can only be from the same day that said if tomatoes are now so sour it s because they are grown with tons of shitty chemicals when we take them in the garden they are smaller more concentrated in taste and balance 98 of the tomatoes produced today are tasteless watermelons subsequently 00 flour is a modern invention why doesn t anyone use the flours from before modern yeasts make aggressive growths there s no tradition in it yet no one complains because like mozzarella it s business why doesn t anyone use sourdough why isn t it mandatory by the italian pizzaollo federation why don t they use old flours for me it s an excuse to don t work on the products and the originality of each restaurant because for me if we only had restaurants like you or him we d never have like pizza hut or shitty company do you have a better recipe than his perfect open a youtube channel write a book give lectures because we don t have too much culture in this world to be able to do without even a little bit i like the san marzano tomatoes of mutti and why u dont use organic tomatoes instead of only organic basil i guess add some tomato concentrate is a no no for u thanks for your recipes american pizza makers should take notice from you cheers great recipe i really love it i just want to mention something i don t know about the italian people but in some countries it s disgusting to put your finger in the sauce and lick it also not to wear gloves shut up it s going into an oven at 700 degrees germaphobe 50 por mes nice if u know how to cook this movie is shit for you sono di napol vivo in indiana bravo how to be lazy and also how to bring the true chianto flavor if you don t have the real mozzarella made from buffalo milk which is more yellow and not plain white and you don t have the oven he has forget about having a real pizza at the end for this non style dish country it might be the best you can get go to tuscany italy and get the real shit you will never see peter piper and little cesaers again for the rest of your life this guy knows what pizza is about continue treating the american people the right way they deserve the truth thanks i would pour everything into a pot and then pulse i was waiting for you to cut yourself with those lids just waiting to cut you are you even italian so your sauce is a canned tomato with some added salt you have to be very skilled to do that bravo perfect simplicity is the key just nice sweet tangy tomatoes and rich salty moz to balance i do mine in a pan with plenty of olive oil oregano salt and garlic it s as simple as it gets and you get to choose the thickness maybe i add the basil and processing part next time ol sou de portugal e adoro os teus v deos vou tentar fazer as tuas pizzas obrigado ciao you have the skill i love napoali tomato i always cook mine first with garlic and onion but will definitely try this thanks for the video italian pizza sauce never has onion if you want to learn the traditional way stay out of onion is just basil tomato salt oil and thats it maybe oregano i also put garlic he reminds me of joey bucaro kevin kline in the movie i love you to death hilarious must watch movie while eating pizza of course right vito indeed lol what you really need is a decent camera that doesn t auto focus continua a parlare ameri cano that guy isn t joking the simpler the better thanks for the tip for great sauce great video making it right in the can like that is brilliant however likely wouldn t work with a small can at home also your teaspoon measuring is highly unprofessional i d totally recommend a scale or at the very least a real measuring spoon the sauce is so simple and it s so good ueh vaglio seti vedono a napoli ti bastonano hahah ero a napoli per 6 anni 0 vito iacopelli salve vito io sono di rimini sei proprio bravo complimenti e un buon sense of humor io avevo 2 ristoranti a san francisco chef propretario ora pensionato buon natale vito thanks vito looks i always buy the crushed san marzano in the can because the whole peeled ones have all of those seeds how

subscribed and shared thanks for sharing this with us thanks vito you good man vito let god help you show us how to wipe asses and pussies and tell us how to blow our noses momo s momo s muy bueno vito abrazo grande desde argentina this guy is trying to much with the accent italian sauce comming from a can seriously you don t know what you are talking about canned tomatoes are used in napoli as well cause they are picked at peak ripeness for canning you can t get great tomatoes year round that s why you used canned ones or make it at home buy tomatos or grow them and when ripe just put them in a glass container with sea salt and pure olive oil along with basil grown in your backyard right mix them like in this video and continue to follow instructions i love the passion this guys puts in his videos he represents his country pretty well imo man i ve met some italian people trough years and these guys are awesome they don t mess with cooking and they don t mess with food at all cooking seems to be more of an art there it s part of the culture deeply rooted in the ages and it s a living art in no other country cooking comes close to be as cultural as it is in italy and it seems that cooking is important in all families i mean i m french and i live in france food means something here for us for sure like 1000 times more than in germany for example but our dear italian neighbourghs they re just the next level of cooking and napoli southern italy seems to be the hq of their cooking art what size are the cans of tomato sauce you are using so i can try and work out the proportion of ingredient i need for a smaller can for home use thanks 2 89 kilogram food service cans bloody hell there are some self proclaimed experts making comments on here some make sense whilst others speak drivel i daresay none has actually cooked pizzas in a restaurant but are rather enthusiastic amateurs anyhow vito thanks for sharing your method of making tomato sauce a very simple and no nonsense approach the san marzano debate brings to mind the arguments around the quality of real champagne versus that produced by m thode champenoise there s an interesting article here about a comparison made between canned tomatoes for anyone who might be interested https www epicurious com expert advice best canned tomatoes san marzano italian taste test article hello how are you i wonder what you put in the sauce was salt or sugar and this sheet i m from brazil i really wanted to learn the customs of italian pizzeria hug beautiful canal salt best pizza sauce bar none to make a large amount like this mr vito how long can i store for please can tomato basil salt 7 min video to wet san marzano tomatoes originate from the small town of san marzano sul sarno near naples italy and were first grown in volcanic soil in the shadow of mount vesuvius that s a great video thank you very much vito thank you for the video when you use the entire contents of the can which includes the liquid doesn t it make the sauce too thin and liquidy which makes the sauce cause the pizza soggy and week i take the tomatoes out of the can and leave the liquid out you get less sauce for the money you paid for the can even if you blend less it gets too watery for me what is the white stuff he calls sauce makes no sense all that back round noise was drowning you out what did you say tea spoon or table spoon thanks for all the vid now i make pizz at home like evhery week i dont want to buy pizza its better at home need an oven stone ciao vito ricorda che il basilico non va messo nel pomodoro ma solo ed esclusivamente sulla pizza in cottura too bland im cooking this sauce but the difference is im using pink fresh tomatoes also i need this sauce for a homemade oven and im not very satisfied with the taste when the tomatoes are raw thats why i cook them for 2 3 minutes and like much better otherwise if i dont cook them i feel the sauce too sour with a strong flavour s yo le pongo un poco de cebolla i do with onion and taste good what do you thing dude there is a difference between teaspoon and tablespoon ty chef fabulous videos vito maybe upgrade your blender as it looks like an el cheapo from china haha love your technique and passion for cooking flour have inspired me to start making traditional pizzas at home just fresh basil ya right boujardo what s the of salt the can is 2

tomato sauce you need tomato sauce what were you expecting bananas i d love the recipe with fresh natural tomatoes canned are different around the world and are already flavored high quality canned tomatoes are not flavored much just read the ingredients to make sure for fresh tomatoes you can roast them or boil them and peel off the skin then do what he does blend with salt maybe sugar if the tomatoes are bitter from there you can add whatever you like evoo garlic basil oregano or just keep it simple what was that that you added to the tomato sauce with the spoon flour sugar salt salt thanks so much vito really appreciate the simplicity of this https youtu be xoeghe3ay4k here learn from here the blender is forbidden to be used for pizza sauce it breaks the seeds and give sour taste and can t taste the real tomato anymore this vito is a fraud of pizzaiolo less is more was that a scoop of salt or parmesan cheese you said a scoop of tomatoe sauce can t fucken understand this guy lukas lysiak ahahaha come on is easy lol james reed is salt brain davison in their defence he also said to make tomato sauce you need tomato sauce and another time referred to the salt as tomato sauce hahahaha my italian sucks though so i m not talking shit to vito just saying sea salt sakimano sea salt james reed cocaine give the guy a break english is not his language messes up some words so what asswipes in here lol james reed sea salt is that balboa lol a9 yes but we want to learn don t say sauce its its salt because we might think its parmigiano lmao can anyone say exactly how much salt to add lukas lysiak take the wax out of your ears then i understand him fine lukas lysiak watch your tone lukas lysiak tell you what if you think you re tough enough we can meet up and figure it out somehow a9 relax they arnt talking shit mostly joking its hard to determine thought salt but looked like flour salt does not look like that on a spoon flour does blender is the wrong way to mix your sauce it emulsifies it hand crushed is the only way also this guy isn t using true san marzanos look for d o p bischlarbo69 they are real san marzano but can t be called san marzano if they are grown outside italy whole canned tomatoes crushed with a potato masher is my way to go what is that white stuff you added to the tomatoes you said that it was tomato sauce was it sugar or salt salt why you need sea salt for tomato sauce what is san marzano style authentic san marzano tomatoes grow on the sides of volcanic ash rich soil i don t know of any volcanoes in california so what do you mean by

underrated comment that blender sounds like me after a heavy night of drinking very commercial and fast the fast sauce is for restaurant to save time and serve a lot of ppl to make money the real pizza sauce is much richer contains more ingredients and take 45 minutes to make if not more more important the san marzano style you use is not the same as the original sam marzano tomato i am sorry it is a shame for an italian to say so sam marzano real tomatoes come from a specific region in italy and they only come from there not like these cheaper ones trying to imitate also the cam they come in even contains basil you dont have to add any duhaskfhawkfhkawbhf and the tomato itself came from the americas san marzano region originally was tomato less named dinapoli sauce comes from america served in italian pizzeria pls kill me now u used fucking canned tomatoes that s make ur sause crap torcher sound hi nice video what was the stuff in the heaping table spoon that he put in each can before the basil i listened a few times and i couldn t make it out thanks i can t wait to try this sauce i m hungry from watching this video it s sea salt is that reall only this nothing else quanto sale olio niente grazie at 2 20 he said one scoop of tomato sauce did he mean sugar salt screw this shit just buy ragu american from usa rochester ny what the shit did he say hello sir i am opening

thing you forgot was the oregano oregano is what gives pizza that great pizza flavor heehee san marzano style non significa che vero san marzano mi pare che in america ci sono troppe cose false che vorrebbero apparire italiane http www ilcasalingodivoghera it san marzano la dop piu imitata perfino in italia what s all the fuss about here shoprite aisle 12 victoria s or rao s jar pizza sauce one large pizza dough 3 00 from my favorite pizza restaurant and galbani fresh mozzarella polly o or sargento mozzarella yummy one 550 degree pre heated pizza stone and we pig out stupid actions do this in one box i m sorry vito but you cannot say san marzano style are the same as the real san marzano from the foot hills of mount vesuvius where rich volcanic soil feeds these vines the ones you are using are from new jersey you of all people should know better than to compare american gmo to your homeland gingly joe sorry joe italians thought tomatoes were toxic until they got schooled by the mesoamericans who had been developing breeding eating them for about a millennium before italy caught on around the 1690s they caught on quick helped by the spanish who brought them back from the americas with recipes and began genetically modifying breeding for taste texture color the fruit over a few hundred years to get the wonderful san marzano so don t forget the italians who imported it had an open mind which could learn and also perfected it as a gmo when you are scolding someone to know better too long 1 america is the homeland of the tomato 2 improvements can happen great now make a video on making a spicya meat ball pero ora mio papa e in italia e quindi sono qui e si sono triste perche si mio papa li e si ciao ciao vito iacopelli napoil e bello ciao come on vito you know that you always use your hands and never a blender its only san marzano and salt period ask any pizzaiolo in napoli some places over in naples use basil and even add olive oil but you are right that most use just tomatoes and salt but it would be pretty boring to eat the same tasting pizza all over town wouldn t it would be just like fast food and chain restaurants wtf was the first ingredient he said tomato sauce and it was a heaping tablespoon not a teaspoon what do you think of mutta san marzano they are the only san mazano i can get in my country not cheap james 4 4 you adulterous people don t you know that friendship with the world means enmity against god therefore anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of god thank you this is how we make our pizza sauce at home tomatoes and a pinch of salt 28 oz can the ken forkish book the elements of pizza is our new bible couple comments he s pulsing low and slow to keep it from being too watery i just touch the blender 2 3 times is all using rega san marzano whole peeled tomatoes already canned with basil leaves and yes they have the dop stamp for customs to show they re from italia and specifically the mt vesuvius area i make a sauce once a year in the fall from our garden i have to use lots of paste and or leave the top off the pot to have it reduce down my point is you can get awesome canned tomatoes nowadays fresh from the garden are good but inconsistent and ten times more watery i love the look in the video of the bright red whole peeled tomatoes yum did u add sugar at the beginning sea salt it s not ketchup you want sugar get that jarred ragu or prego garbage nice i went in the us navy in 1965 my first ship was home ported in napoli and i was there for two years the pizza was loved by the entire crew and they were only a dollar back then apparently napoli has changed a lot since then our pizza and spaghetti was very simple but delicious they didn t use tomato sauce pizza was olive oil cooked tomato mozzarella and that was it the dough was so amazing and it s very hard to find it in america it was a very chewy dough that had a flavor i can t even describe the spaghetti was much the same but they put ground romano and parmesan thomas sour dough maybe thanks for sharing thomas yes i wonder why they use canned tomatoes don t get me wrong i ve used san marzano canned and the result is delicious but with such a strict recipe they should use natural tomatoes like im sure they used before since there was no way to put them in a can wenceslao futanaki tomatoes aren t in season all year canned tomatoes that were grown and picked in season are better than tomatoes that were grown and picked out of season brian taylor thanks i was in rome in 235 a c and the seafood was amazing thomas canned tomatoes are cooked tomatoes in a large portion of the world ripe tomatoes are seasonal thus without using canned tomatoes the sauce would be seasonal as well whether it s from fresh tomatoes or canned tomatoes the thick tomato liquid put on pasta or pizza is a sauce same principle as making gravy a thick liquid often made with flour usually poured over another foodstuff or perhaps a thinner liquid such as soy sauce or worcestershire sauce yes i an neapolitan born and raised and i was taught to mix olive oil in the raw tomatoes sauce wenceslao futanaki canning tomatas is not a bad thing and in the science of it it helps best is bianco dinapoli organic whole peeled tomatoes canned overbuilt automotive thanks i ll try those well yeah depends in the method of canning as well https healyeatsreal com why you should never use canned tomatoes 2 14 why do u put your filthy fingers in the tomato sauce basil is organic but tomato is from california vito come stai beato a te che stai in california e te mangi quessa bella pizza saluti ciao i can never find san marzano tomatoes at my local grocer couldnt i use a bottle of passato or a tomato paste puree great video vito hi vito for one more time you have been made a really good job with all this tutorial videos i want to ask you if it is true what the best way to crush the tomatoes is using a vegetable mile cause it keeps the seeds from the tomatoes so our sauce it s going to be less bitter what do you have to say about that thanks a lot for your concern to answer to me looks like the trick to good sauce is a good can opener lol the truth is pizza sauce has to come out of the can because tomatoes are not avail year round everyone s sauce comes out of can yours looks good my friend thank you ok no baking soda no olive oil no garlic or onion just salt and tomato i do this at work but we use to cook marinara with these dinapoli cans by caramelizing fennel garlic onion and deglaze and reduce with balsamic vinegar and red wine then we d put the cans on the pot and add basil thyme and chili flakes i think it s so much better but my chef says this method is better tomatos form a can uhhh no thanks thats how i do mine drizzle extra virg olive oil and chopped fresh garlic on top before the cheese yum grazia brave bene fatto kaaaalleeeefornyah san marzano style tomatoes pass hi which tomato sauce brand would you recommend in italy thank you for the video warsame adam mutti is that salt one spoon vito thank you for sharing this recipe where is the banjo player how long is the pizza dough good for after its made can i put the rest of the pizza dough balls in the fridge sei il pi forte grazie vito congratulazione so let me get this straight an italian guy is making a traditional italian tomato sauce using wait for it american tomatoes oh dear god no real italian or person from napoli would use electric blender on san marzano tomatoes we crush using hands the machine heat when blitzing will add bitterness to the tomatoes this is not authentic snob vito s running a pizzeria not a 4 star restaurant to get really good neapolitan pizza sauce you should use neapolitan canned tomatoes costco has them in a green large can called nino tomatoes and they are imported from italy and make great sauce it costs about 3 30 for a large can check out my pizza oven build if you guys get the chance awesome thanks vito i love the smell of fresh basil anybody else cringe when he plunges the blade in the cut the can open i always feel like he s going to cut a finger off lol i m confuse is that a table spoon of salt you said teaspoon of sauce salt add 1 tea spoon of tomato sauce into the tomato can and blend it walla and make sure watch the whole thing to make sure you waste all 6 7min of your life lol or use fresh tomatoes i can t understand how can italians be so extremely snob about food and yet use canned tomatoes canned tomatoes are vacuum sealed at peak ripeness so they will typically be fresher and sweeter than the tomatoes you buy which have likely gone past their peak freshness that is no way and italian sauce for pizzas it s awful shit cans came with basil how to make tomato sauce for pizza so yu need canned tomato sauce lol wtf thought he would make it frm scratch hey wheres a you shop i lika to taste a you pizza fyi there is no a in the word blender in english i am so sorry if this comes across as negative but you desperately need a better sound recording system you can just barely hear his voice and he often turns away from the camera please love the authentic cooking and recipes thank you stan shyer i m so sorry this video is very old i updated everything look into my newest videos and let me know what you think 0 use scalfani hand picked san marzano tomatoes with no citric acid the no citric acid is the key there will be no acidic sour taste to your sauce irregardless of what recipe you use and thus you will not need to add sugar yuk to cover up the acidic taste from canned tomatoes again no citric acid amazing looks the best 5 38 f ck off in the background haha awesome video thanks for sharing god bless you my friend soon i will visit italy with my family what is your pizzeria called he is in usa 6 in 1 are good tomatoes too utter shit too watery just because your italian doesn t mean you can make a good pizza title draining the juice from the tomatoes and adding some crushed garlic to the sauce is a must for me but thanks for the video chef what is the quantity of one tomate cane rajiv thapa i don t really understand your question you have shown in the video that the size of napolian tomate sause i want to know how much the quantity of that tomate cane 2 litre 2 5 litre 3 litre 5 litre you are adorable another wonderful video thanks for sharing your ingredients look so good i would like to order a couple of your pizzas thanks again for like almost 10 litres of tomate sause how much quantities of all ingredients should i have to use hai seriamente frullato il basilico your sauce too thin is it easier to just dump the cans of tomatoes into that large bucket then use the mixer to grind them up instead od doing it in each can like that myredtail no if you can mount that kind of a can opener somewhere in your home ii is by far the best can opened that you can buy good investment will last a lifetime also there are simpler and smaller ones which do not cut the metal inside the plate but remove the top cap from can investigate what i mean i think idea has it the edges are smooth it just removes the top element from the can can this sauce be frozen if so for how long will it stay good in the freezer etc forgetaboutit if it s not brooklyn made style pizza sauce beautiful beautiful red sauce omg you said 100x dinapoli makes the video worst sorry sundance kid so sorry about that this video is very old now we make better videos 0 very fabulous thanks how kg this box asif hussain is 3kl per can realpizza one nice scoop of tomato sauce did he mean cheese salt salt salt some people should really watch their mouth you won t have this guy knowledge in years where s the salt quando hai scritto don t forget passion ho detto grande perche per me fare la pizza non solo un lavoro una vera passione grande mi piace i tuoi video per fare la pizza grazie per sapere hey vito is it alright to cook toss the tomatoes in some garlic oil just to give it some extra flavour i want to make the sauce myself right from the beginning including cooking the tomatoes if anyone want better quality then should drain water and then crush tomato does anyone know aht he puts there this white stuff is it parmigiana cheese keep it up vito i can see in the comments that people are very rude to you by any reasons just move on and continue doing your videos good luck sergio rocco thank you so much i don t really pay attention is just jealousy i like the video but california tomatoes verses italy grown tomatoes shocked me really ct i grow san marzano tomatos in my yard i live in missouri they are still san mazano tomatos they are heirloom tomatos sergio rocco was sergio rocco we live you rocco and your mother in law vito iacopelli besides the obvious rude comments if people comment is to give feedback like customers they could just walk off and never come back take some ideas from it keep doing what you do but improve the consistency 1 tea spoon is a cucchiaino not a cucchiaio as you said in the final video and the minipimer you should know it s a no no as it increases the overall acidity of the tomatoes and kills their natural sweetness vito thank you f r sharing this wonderful technique keep inspiring maraming salamat justathought think he has a restaurant in ca so that s probably why climate is similar to that of italy great job man thank you for your efforts lol you said one big spoon of tomato sauce in each container lolol vor tex you said you said you said just watch my friend and please share on fb vor tex 0 my friend i understand you are new to the game and would like to make a name for yourself but while making these videos the people are listening to what you say fr them to do in this case noone knows what you pot into the sace with a tablespoon yet respect the craft from one pizzaiolo to another bon apetito vor tex i don t really understand your point i do videos for all my viewers to learn the real italian style of making the real pizza neapolitan style i have 27 years of making pizzas and no one taught me anything of the secrets of making neapolitan pizzas but i still made it very good so way the people need to do what i did to make a good pizza so i decided to make videos and tell all the secrets if you don t like my job is ok i will make more and more videos anyway and this is just the beginning thank you for taking the time and watching my videos ps i m not the new one here in the video you didnt say exactly what you put in the sauce my friend this is all im saying dont get upset im just trying to help vor tex thank you so much for your help i m not upset or mad i m just answering to your comments i don t plan or write my videos i just make it sorry if i make some mistake here and there so what was the white stuff in the spoon kosher salt or sugar or a mix of both he raises a legitimate question your video should have the recipe in the text at least if you can t get english translation right with that said this is the way i ve always made my sauce it looks great and i hope i can try one of your pizzas one day vor tex fuck you actually there is already some basil in the can isn t it so how much do you recommend if its only tomato and juice in the can how many gram of salt do i need tomatoes have already basil inside see label yes i like with extra basil 0 that has to be the most bizarre technique i ve ever seen to make a pizza sauce but why do you fold the lid of the tin down why not just dump it into the bin also unless you sanitized the top of the can why would you want the sauce to come into contact with the tin lid yes we know how to use a fucking can opener thank you i was told not to use a blender when there are seeds because if the seeds are broken open by the blender the broken seeds will make the sauce bitter is this true or not make the the sauce acidic you can tell this is authentic because of his italian hand gestures what is san marzano style they re either san marzano or not you can t have in the style it is or is not san marzano is a variety luigi luigi the game stuff not oregano and garlic pyro george nope how do you make marinara sauce the salt looks more like a tablespoon than a teaspoon joe orefice agree do you not cook the sauce before using it on pizza dough no sugar no onions no oregano corunja marados no hi vito is that one teaspoon or tablespoon of salt per tin cheers vito 1 teaspoon or 1 tablespoon in a 1 can what a joke excelent simple fresh tasty the way food should be i thought you were going to reallly show how to make to tomatoe sauce you got a can canned tomatoes like in the video are actually the best way to get the tomatoes at peak ripeness unless you re growing and picking them yourself teaspoon my ass that s a tablespoon at least he said a little spoon no he said 1 tea spoon he said tea spoon it s more like 15 tea spoons im a little late but i do assume you don t buy huge ass cans like these and if you don t it d be a tea spoon for you i just think it s funny he uses sea salt and if you can organic basil then uses sham marzano style california tomatoes bwahahaha pay the extra buck and get real italian san marzanos this just like saying to her just the tip it doesn t matter dont u know he mentioned in his other videos that he speak english just a little bit dont be too perfect words are not really important in making pizza sauce thanks for sharing your videos i love you vito first there s no sense to buy san marzano style they just means they are roma tomatoes what makes san marzano tomatoes from italy so good is the soil where they are from around mt vesuvius there is no replicating it outside that area second you should actually strain the cans of tomato first removing the liquid which is mainly water you can use this liquid in sauces later but you need to cook it down to get a thicker stronger flavor without doing this you will hve very watered down sauce with much less flavor the reason many don t do this is cost if he did this it would result in 50 less sauce but what he has is not as flavorful or authentic sure he s italian but not all italians do the right thing first he has a video about getting rid of the water secondly has his own restaurant meaning his customers keep coming back for his pizzas clearly he s doing something right and is making a profit from it well you know what they say pizza is like sex even when it s bad it s still pretty good people fill up pizza hut too i m with bluehen true san marzano all the way and drain most of the liquid i m not convinced he s italian lol joey van der velden zo egoistisch die amerikanen zij geloven dat ze alles weten uh he is cooking it in an 900 degree wood oven the water is reduced quickly during this stage and the sauce doesn t become stiff and thus you get that bold flavor this is in accordance with the dop instruction set forth in napoli for authentic naples pizza just because you say it isn t the right way doesn t make you right appreciate different pizzas in all different styles there s no such thing as the correct pizza i ve had pizza s with a rich sauce and they were good the sauce came through as a highlight i ve had pizza s with a thinner sauce and they were good the crust and mozzarella wasn t overpowered by a rich sauce they re all good it s pizza this is very similar to giada s recipe which is also awesome thanks this is the sauce recipe the you use for ur restaurant thank you vito for your videos ciao grazie mille you meant salt right yeah thanks i love your videos vito i just finished building the wood fired mattone barile grande brick oven your videos are the best on youtube i still need to dry out the oven but i did try this sauce recipe i am on a low salt diet and using the cento brand tomatoes from walmart and no added salt it was wonderful 20 mg sodium per 1 2 cup per 16 pizza it is the best and so easy with the kitchenaid hand blender i subscribed and am learning a lot from your videos and sharing with all my friends it s rather interesting to see this when i started to make pizza at home i found very different sauce recipes so i ve been making sauce with pepper a bit of sugar olive oil oregano in them but most importantly cooked before put on the dough i will definitely try this easy one a bit of sugar cuts acid thats what it is for in tomatoes use either oregano or basil they don t go well together anyways oregano shouldn t touch a good pizza oregano and basil mix well with spaghetti sauce how would you change this tomato sauce if you were going to use it on spaghetti sautee some onion garlic and oil and add your sauce cook for 20 25 mins if your adding bones and sausage and you want that kind of sauce than bring it to a boil and cook on low for 1 2 hrs until it reduces how you like only do 4 ingredients 2 cans good quality crushed whole peeled tomatoes one whole onion sea salt and butter quantity in marcella hazan s recipe thanks for sharing your video contenitore da da 1 kilo sandeep kumarsuman no da 3 kl meraviglioso e un grande

must use a real italian bleander for authentic genuine results with this recipe use of a north american blender will result in a tomato sauce of the type served at mcdonalds u just got trolled mongol andrew g whitaker i hope that you are joking with this because i m italian and in italy everyone uses the same blander what s the difference i am being a bit of a spelling nazi in italy you use a bleander or a blander bland means boring plain uninteresting in north america we only have blender jokes are never funny when explained andrew g whitaker sorry but still don t understand andrew respect the craft dont be an idiot it needs to be funny in order to be considered a joke epic fail andrew vito iacopelli he s trying to make fun of the way you said bleander rather then blender because of the accent american humor can be a little dry stale sometimes lol you speak very good english by the way andrew sono minguini no te preocupade vito auguri no it was the way it was spelled on the subtitle bleander 0 57 min not true i have an american blender worked swell ps if you over use the blender it will be runny in that event tomato paste is a great thickener andrew g whitaker ii andrew g whitaker va fa n culo schemo wasting everyone s time with your trumpian narcissim idiot or in italian idiota hand under chin emiliall martucci get the fuck out a here with your politics ha ha how about the real san marzano italian tomatoes way too expensive 100 percent spot on we use hands to crush the tomatoes the heat from metal blender will add bitterness to the tomatoes also a little texture is good not a fully blitzed sauce it was pretty funny until you tried to explain it lol what tomato sauce is served at mcdonalds andrew g whitaker hallo even i am italian and being old i do not know english well i had noticed the mistake of the word blaender but after all who does not know well the language of another country could make some mistakes or not if i asked you to speak in italian would you speak it perfectly anyway i read your comment with a note of irony and humor i do not think the case to take it for what you said greetings andrew g whitaker your jokes don t seem to be funny whether you explain them or not andrew g whitaker fu yfi andrew g whitaker go and stick to your fast food mcd pizza hut and whatever other garbage you inhale you fat fuck andrew you are a moron i hope you know you re not funny and disrespectful for the guy that made the video to teach people like you to make incredible pizzas and you arrive and just piss on him stronzo nice video keep

teaspoon pepper flecks 3 tbs olive oil 2 clove of garlics whole mix well simmer under low heat to thicken up remove from heat then move into freg over night was that salt john gallo yes sea salt john gallo i went to high school in the 70s in modesto ca what was the spoon of white you added to the tomatoes i could not hear what is what it was michael flaherty sea salt sea salt i am on a low salt diet and if you re restricted on sodium try leaving it out you won t miss it one bit no one heard it michael because he called it tomato sauce but it looked like kosher salt sea salt leaving out the salt does impact the flavor quite a bit you re left with bland sauce sea salt but it looks like he aded a tablespoon not a teaspoon to each number ten large can perhaps he made a mistake in the translation and the difference of a tea spoon from a soup or table spoon its better to use salt with caution as little as u like but not enough u lose the flavor of tomatoe it enhances the flavor also u know so it works both ways too much too salty too little not enoujgh salt you can also use soy sauce great stuff slight of hand postcaptain57 nice and simple what weight were the tins of tomatoes please kinda important hard to read from when you held up thanks you he was using commercial size 10 cans 6lb 6oz 102oz 2 89kg b minor thank you i love this 3 ingredients only needed for fantastic taste and awesome texture well tomatoes are like steak if you get good ones they have their own flavor personally i don t use san marzano style grown in the usa i like the true italian tomatoes it s not like it s a huge price difference if any cento alessi both make good ones pomi is also good as a base sauce bloozedaddy i go for the local tomatoes at least they don t stay 45 day i a container getting hot and cold in the ocean bloozedaddy f way watery for my pizzas johno f it is a way to remove the water i will make a video also thank you for comment i wasn t knocking your sauce if it sounded like that i cook in a home oven at 550f where the sauce doesn t dry up very much me in the usa stick to the 6 in 1 brand by escalon imported costly and low yield canned tomatoes have always been a let down for me johno f right yeah hand crushing and straining would be perfect that is not making a sauce that came from a can have you ever been in an italian pizzeria i mean in italy expertoffx yes and that s how we make sauce for a italian pizza 0 pumpkinsnblackcats that s funny because i own a tomato farm and own a pizza restaurant and disagree what do you do for a living peace alright maybe you use fresh tomatoes to make sauce because you may have a huge amount of tomatoes no the italian pizzaioli who doesn t own a huge amount of tomatoes normally use canned tomatoes even because they can have a smooth texture fiorefabrizio so now it s amount not consistency lol ok well i work in a greengrocer store the farm that provides us fruits and vegs is specialised in apples we do loads of apple juices we do as you do we got a lot of apples apple juice you got a lot of tomatoes tomato sauce shall i send you a power point fiorefabrizio i could care less about what you do smfh is how i believe that you started out speaking to me followed by you don t know better do you then it s nothing about what you said it s about making you a troll bye bye now where do you live which country ok no worries it s pretty obvious you ll never get it nevermind fiorefabrizio i get it you perfer to not use fresh products don t attempt to make it about where i m from just like i m not making it about what employees think about where they work expertoffx just come to italy and see how it works fiorefabrizio maybe i m italy ok good now see how it works legend has it that esposito was called upon to make a pizza for italian king umberto i and queen margherita when they visited naples in 1889 that pizza which featured fresh tomatoes mozzarella cheese and basil is still known as pizza margherita today keyword fresh my friend peace oh hey mr wikipedia fine 128 years ago i guess they didn t use can tomatoes see how it works in the present fiorefabrizio digital watches are cheap

every time i made pizza it was different i will try your sauce and i need to pay your restaurant a visit cheers i will try it thank you master vito bravo regards from south of brazil san marzano style correct he said style that s because the name san marzano tomato is an actual trademark that is protected by the eu enforced by international trade agreements so you can get the exact same tomatoes but if they re not made in san marzano italy you have to call them san marzano style eu trademark protection is also the reason why we no longer label any sparkling wine made outside champagne france champagne or any parmesan type cheese made outside parma and surrounding areas like reggio emilia italy parmesan 1093944483 i have finally found a simple recipe for pizza base sauce thanks sound

immigrant as well you can even use fresh roma tomatoes but there are some things you can do to boost their flavor and improve their texture quickly blanch the roma tomatoes whole in rapidly boiling water only long enough to loosen the skin remove the skins but set them aside in a small bowl slice the peeled tomatoes into quarters strain the seeds with a fine mesh sieve over a bowl to collect the tomato gel and any excess tomato juice at this point you should only have the roma tomato flesh crush the tomato flesh with your hands or pulse them gently in a blender or food processor the consistency should be somewhere between chunky and soupy set it aside in a large bowl with some basil leaves and crushed dry oregano or fresh oregano if it is available and keep it chilled in the refrigerator for the moment in a sauce pot pan add olive oil and the tomato skins stir them together first then turn on the flame to low medium heat to begin cooking them and to break down their tough texture as the tomato skins begin to shrivel up bring the flame down to low and add the reserved tomato gel and any reserved juices from the tomatoes and either bring them up to temperature or simply cook it until the mixture has been reduced you re making a concentrated tomato reduction while the mixture is hot add everything it to a blender or food processor blend it into a smooth puree collect it into a bowl and let it cool slightly bring out the crushed tomato flesh from the fridge combine the two stir them together you ll end up with a sauce that has both ends of the spectrum raw fresh tomato flavor concentrated cooked tomato flavor and the best part of it is that the result won t be as runny or watery enjoy rkmugen seriously you feel the need to write all this on a maestro pizzaioli s wall ego ego maybe a poop fell on you rkmugen ky oi di ol i think it s good clear instructions you can hate on him all you want this gives you non runny sauce that is worthwhile you might be surprised but canned tomatoes taste better fresh tomatoes are transported while they are raw sithu kyaw great point sithu canned tomatoes are canned at the peak of ripeness the tomatoes are allowed to ripen dark red on the vine before picking how many lbs of tomatoes do you recommend for your version this sounds incredible more up my alley sounds good too fresh tomatoes taste no different then canned tomatoes why do they taste the same because both canned and fresh tomatoes are cooked to the same amount this is the only thing that makes canned foods taste different they tend to taste overcooked but tomatoes sauces are cooked for hours and as such even freshly cooked tomatoes will taste like canned cooked tomatoes i just tried it with some campari tomatoes we had that were a little too ripe so i tried this instead of throwing them out it turned out amazing and didn t take all that long thank you thank you thank you sithu kyaw fresh farmers market garden tomatoes are better than canned so this was very helpful if you want the best tom foolery careful to not leave it laying everywhere because that s how you get ants ciao vito ti saluto dal venezuela e vorrei farti una domanda non si cucina la salsa dei pommodori per la pizza mia madre sempre la cucinava e io anche si metti l aglio pommodoro e or gano secco e si cuoce per 15 min giuseppe bonaiuto no perche la salsa anche se e nei contenitori e gia cotta quindi e meglio non ricuocerla per tante volte giuseppe bonaiuto scusate se mi intrometto non sono un pizzaiolo ma mi piace cucinare per chiarire meglio i tuoi dubbi direi che la salsa si cucina comunque nel forno assieme alla pizza dunque non serve cucinarla prima per esempio una buona idea cucinare la base della pizza con la salsa un p prima di aggiungere gli altri condimenti di modo da dargli tempo di asciugarsi un pelino cucinare prima la salsa credo la renda un p troppo spessa e saporita rubando un p di protagonismo alla pizza in se ovviamente ci sono infinite varianti per fare la pizza in casa che spesso sono abbastanza diverse dalla pizza che mangi in pizzeria ma comunque buone cucinare la salsa prima forse aiuta a seconda del forno a me capitato di cucinarla prima perch in viaggio non avevamo altro che un barbecue parrilla e ho dovuto fare pizza alla grilgia vito soy de argentina me pasas la receta de la verdadera pizza italiana san marzano style tomatoes are not real san marzanos from italy this is just more food industry bs for people who don t know or care the sm tomatoes have to be grown in the soil and climatic conditions of the country from which they evolved gregbrooklyn i don t know if you re trying to correct vito people in the comment section or you just want to show everyone how much you know but he addressed that clearly in the video saying they are essentially copycat variants from california not italy no shit sherlock he expresses it multiple times they are from california he hat s off to vito for supporting the local california farmers if you want certified italian grown tomatoes go to walmart look for the cento brand san marsano tomatoes funny cos the san marzano strain is originally from mexico tomatoes are not native to italy san marzano strain actually comes from mexico dond tell me is the real italian sauce for making pizza is not true please do you have a better true one if so please let us know jaime better yet why don t you post your own video with your real italian sauce i always despise people who criticizes other s work when they don t have the motivation to make their own video sooo put your money where your mouth is at and make a video oh maker of real italian sauce jaime mercado some people just use tomato pure not much else you can make a pizza with pure it s ok ok some questions a what about the seeds b in some videos people cook the sauce in olive oil you don t cook the sauce at all or is it already cooked in the can they should already be cooked during the canning process no cooking needed it will cooks in the owen mestro vito i pomodori vanno schiacciati con le mani non col frullatore lo puoi fare negli usa non in italia antonio salvatore blancato grazie io anche in italia lo visto fare sempre con le macchine il problema e come fai a fare 15 20 casse di pomodori al giorno con le mani fammelo sapere che ci provo quasta che non ci mettiamo una giornata a presto vito iacopelli hai ragione ma credo che nel profondo del tuo cuore mi dai ragione a me comunque non mi aspettavo una tua risposta dimostri di essere una persona seria complimenti ti ringrazio sicuramente si hai ragione quando sono a casa li faccio a mano ma perch devo solo fare 2 3 pizze a presto grazie ciao vito iacopelli hahaha vero vito questi qua per non usare le macchine aprono anche le scatole dei pomodori con le mani fresh tomatoes from the can what do you think about mixing only with hands to avoid the acidity in the seeds too much work yes but san marezano tomatoe is sweet pizzaiolo napolitain san marzano style big difference legacy maiden so not the same name pizzaiolo napolitain dude you are not using san marzano tomatoes canned san marzanos when grown in the valle del sarno valley of the sarno in italy in compliance with italian law can be classified as pomodoro s marzano dell agro sarnese nocerino and have the eu dop emblem on the label vito thanks for sharing i know from video that da michele in napoli does the same thing by just blending the whole can of tomatoes from tony gemignani i learnt to remove the juice in the can the seeds and flower stem from tomatoes without doing this the sauce is very wet too thin and the seeds can make it bitter this is how i ve done it when making my own san marzarno sauce it is too much work so i usually make my sauce with other tomatoes which are already chopped to pieces or a base sauce question is if tony and i are crazy going to such detail jacob pedersen you re not crazy i was removing the seeds and juice from the can you re right it s just to wet for pizza sauce still using san marzano s but chopped with some seeds never a complaint from my family and friends mishatal1 even when i remove the juice i end up with only about half a liter of sauce from a 5 kg can of dop san marzano tomatoes this sauce is still very wet expensive and a lot of work for so little i ve been happy with all the marzano products i ve bought so i just switched to smaller cans of the product jacob pedersen during the course of this year i have gone through the same thing de michele videos tony germanini than casually arrived here i am trying to make a pizza napoletana or margherita with a home oven i think you are going through too much pain following tony because he goes in too much detail makes it a pain to start making a pizza in the book he uses malt he uses a starter lets the dough proof too long it is a real pain i would just suggest you watch you probably have the great gennaro contaldo he is amazing and makes things very simple like he says on the video quot it is cheapy and easy quot i done some experimenting myself tried to make pizza with only with the juice and only with the tomatoes from the can the juice didn 39 t taste good while if you separate the tomatoes they feel fresh so even i don 39 t use the juice anymore or use too little to make the sauce thinner but to go to the details of the seeds and the stem it would take me hours to do that and i can 39 t find san marzano probably they have less seeds than the ones i am using they are kind of san marzano but smaller i found some piccadilly tomatoes which are amazing for pasta but never tried to make a fresh pizza sauce with those will try they look exactly like san marzano i don 39 t know if they are better because i have never tasted san marzano myself too much pain is the story of my life i m a perfectionist so i don t just go for good i strive to make the best pizza a goal that is of course never achieved both by technique and ingredients i agree that a long rise will be harder to work with than a short rise not too short but 6 8 hours final product is not that different i use both actually short rise of 6 8 hours makes the nicest looking pizzas i have tried different sour dough starters but yet to find any that made a huge difference san marzano is not my favorite tomato it s wet from the can and does not taste that good perhaps i ve just not been lucky with those brands i ve tested i ve tried to grow my own san marzano but not had enough luck to have enough to make a sauce yet perhaps next summer i post some of my experiments with food on instagram blezedk i d love to know more about your experiments grande vito la ricetta pi importante la passione come dici te
